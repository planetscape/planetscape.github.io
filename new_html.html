    <p>
        Scour our searchable, sortable and public database of Trump administration financial disclosures to probe the mysterious companies contained within. Or perhaps you have a tip about how a key Trump administration official ’s friends or colleagues stand to benefit from knowing a presidential confidant. But you ’ll find hundreds of other Trump administration officials who serve in critical capacities with minimal fanfare and news coverage. One way to better understand the Trump administration is to understand the vested interests of the president ’s lieutenants, whose salaries are now paid for by U.S. taxpayers. — particularly for Trump ’s financial disclosures — before releasing it as part of the Trump administration financial database.

        In North Dakota, tribes scramble to clear voter ID hurdle 
 By BLAKE NICHOLSONOctober 26, 2018 The skirmish over voter access is n’t limited to North Dakota. American Indians in North Dakota face a unique situation because the state is the only one in the nation without voter registration, meaning they have never really needed a street address to vote. Voters must now be able to prove a residential address. That could potentially disenfranchise thousands of voters on the state ’s five reservations, according to the tribes. The Four Directions group also is helping Native American voters get the addresses they need. It could have been that all 3,600 voters were legitimate voters, but when we ca n’t find them afterward They often have the effect of disenfranchising marginalized voters — people of color and low-income voters.
