          are releasing a letter in opposition to calls to convene a new constitutional convention. The letter focuses on the threat of a “ runaway convention, ” where every American's constitutional rights and protections could be at risk. Under
          Article V of the U.S. Constitution, a convention can be called when two-thirds of the states ( 34 ) petition for a convention to enact amendments to the constitution. Most legal scholars agree that all 34 applications must be on one issue,
          but once a convention is called anything could be brought up. Our first and only constitutional convention took place in 1787.

          compact by passing enabling legislation through their state legislatures. ( The Constitution gives states the authority to select and govern their electors. ) The Compact is triggered when states equaling at least 270 Electoral College
          votes enact the legislation. Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia — representing 189 electoral votes — have passed the NPVIC: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts,

          the Gun Owners of America fully oppose it. Reducing federal power to secure our borders, as invited by the Convention of States legislation, would impose billions of dollars in new costs on states. Conclusion " Thank you.

          An Article V Constitutional Convention ( Con-Con ) is an Urgent Threat to Your Rights
          Since 1787, America has chosen to avoid the risk of a new convention that could rewrite our Constitution and Bill of Rights. But 28 state legislatures have now applied for a convention. The Constitution's Article V says that if 2/3 of the
          states apply ( 34 states ), Congress shall call a convention for proposing amendments. We're asking local, state, and federal elected officials across the country: In about one minute, please tell us why you support constitutional
          enforcement over a constitutional convention. See their videos...

          applications. On May 12, 2015, three Oklahoma state legislators created a video to help persuade Texas legislators to defeat the Article V convention agenda in their state. The Texas legislature did go on to reject all Article V convention
          applications in its 2015 session. What Is an Article V Convention? , Congress shall call such a convention. Congress would send any amendments proposed by the convention to the states for ratification ( three-fourths of the states are

          — In “ The Resurgent BBA Con-Con Drive History of the BBA Con-Con Movement .... Once again, bringing the federal government back into compliance with the powers granted to it by the Constitution was never in the picture. Furthermore, it
          must be emphasized that if the federal government would only follow the Constitution, then the budget would easily be brought into balance. What ’s one of the most noticeable aspects of this being “ out-of-control ”? That ’s exactly what
          happened. Our problem of an “ out-of-control ” government should be described as our “ out-of-compliance-with-the-Constitution ” federal government. Instead, a BBA would have the perverse effect of legitimizing the federal government ’s
          usurpations of powers not granted to it by the Constitution. ” “ ” Arguments Against a BBA Article V Convention •

          Of course, the Convention of States ( COS ), the Compact for America, and other Article V proponents on the right, argue up and down that they are not calling for a new constitutional convention. James Madison is called the Father of the
          Constitution, but is he really? That blueprint and the Constitution that was eventually approved at that convention have very little in common. ’s influence over the Article V convention movement. Balanced budget amendments, term limit
          amendments, and the various other “ power to the people ” amendments backed by the socialist wing of the Article V movement are all, in one way or another, contrary to the intent of the Founders and to the principles of liberty they
          enshrined in the Constitution.

          My long-time Eagle Forum friend, Orlean Koehle, wrote this enlightening article about the Leftists and Leftist organizations that are pushing for a Convention of the States. The COS call for a Balanced Budget Amendment would give the SCOTUS
          control over taxing and spending in the event of a congressional inability to reach agreement and would violate the separation of powers policy. The following article by my long-time Eagle Forum friend Orlean Koehle, should be an eye-opener
          to those who would like to think for themselves instead of simply following the big-name conservatives Behind COS Project. Orlean Koehle has been the State President of Eagle Forum of California since 2002. Needs Revival, Not Revision,

          WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION? ” One of the most serious problems Article V proposes is a runaway convention. There is no enforceable mechanism to prevent a convention from reporting out wholesale changes to our Constitution and Bill
          of Rights. The Convention could fundamentally change our Constitution or replace it altogether. I see no reason to believe that a constitutional convention, 200 years later, could be more narrowly circumscribed. Selection of Delegates for
          the constitutional convention is undefined in the plain language of Article V. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ “ Our intention is to protect the Constitution.
