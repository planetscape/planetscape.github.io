        The current debate is about a movement to call a convention of states to propose a balanced budget amendment, instead of leaving that task to Congress. So far, these 27 amendments have originated in Congress and been sent to the states for approval. Once three-quarters of the individual states ratify an amendment, it becomes the law. It involves petitions from at least 34 states to call a constitutional convention, where one or several amendments are proposed. The amendment or amendments are then sent on to the states, where 38 states are needed for ratification. So in theory, balanced budget proponents need to get seven of the 10 GOP-led states on board with passing amendment petitions.

        Alabama Political Reporter In both cases, the amendment passed either by Congress or the convention must then be ratified by 3/4s of the states. If they ever get 34 states how is Alabama going to choose which delegates go? Orr said that if there is to be an Article V convention the state legislature will appoint six delegates. That is what was used in the 1787 convention. In the event there is ever a convention what would Alabama do? ” The delegates would likely be members of the state legislature, but not necessarily so. The second protection is the convention itself. Finally whatever amendments are proposed at the convention would still have to be ratified by the states.
