          Constitutional Convention, No Dems Allowed
          State bill says GOP picks all delegates to convention championed by Kochs. Image from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Already, 29 states have passed resolutions in favor of such a convention. Wisconsin may be one of them. The Convention
          is limited to proposing only an amendment or amendments to the Constitution of the United States whose subject(s ) were specifically included in the resolutions of at least two-thirds of the several States. ” Under one of these resolutions,
          Wisconsin would get seven delegates to such a convention, and Republican leaders the right to pick all seven of those delegates! One of the resolutions would try to limit the scope of such a convention to a single subject only: The passing
          of a balanced budget amendment. “ ”

          The untried route stipulates that two-thirds of the states can call a constitutional convention. As coincidence would have it, George Mason University is today the core academic base camp of the Koch political operation. As Charles Koch put
          it, the radical right agenda aims to “ get government out of the business of giving goodies. In 2009, the GOP had full control of the legislatures of 14 states. The party has control of the legislatures of another six. Should a
          constitutional convention take place, it could easily become a “ runaway convention. We ’re close to winning, ” observed Mark Holden, the head of Koch Industries ’ government and public affairs operation to a Koch donor summit in late 2015.
          They [ the Koch network ’s critics ] do n’t have the real path.

          Government Lottery Has Big Support We acknowledge that a con con could have unforeseen consequences. The Nov. 2, 1976, vote for a con con was 74 percent in favor to 26 percent against. A con con can also bring forth new leaders. Of the 102
          delegates to the ’ 78 con con, only two were incumbents and two were former legislators. Hawaii voters rejected holding additional con cons in 1986, 1998 and 2008. That's an invalid e-mail.

          On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Legislature voted to call for what ’s known as an Article V constitutional convention, becoming the 28th state to do so in recent years. It ’s no coincidence that it voted Tuesday to call for a federal
          constitutional convention. The convention of states folks talk about how simple this is; this is all about taking back power from Washington. They need six states It could be a runaway convention. There are no certain convention rules laid
          out in the Constitution or a ratification process. There ’s ” I certainly would not want a constitutional convention, ” said   Antonin Scalia, associate justice from 1986 to 2016. “ And that ’s the point.

          advertisement State lawmakers have made Wisconsin the 28th state to request an unprecedented national convention to amend the country's founding document, the U.S. Constitution. But even if we put that aside, it's worth taking a moment to
          emphasize just how bad an idea a constitutional convention would be. So, what's an Article V convention of the states? So how many states need to support a convention to make this happen? After this week, 28, including Wisconsin. Since the
          Constitution ’s creation, how many of these conventions have we seen
          None. This would be the first since the original constitutional convention in 1787. How would convention delegates be chosen?

          propose a balanced-budget amendment. The two-thirds-of-the-states threshold for calling a convention is 34. And, as it happens, there are seven states which have not yet called for a convention to propose a balanced-budget amendment, but in

          To read Nancy MacLean ’s new book, Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right ’s Stealth Plan for America, is to see what was previously invisible. The programme is now reshaping politics, and not just in the US. MacLean
          says that Charles Koch poured millions into Buchanan ’s work at George Mason University, whose law and economics departments look as much like corporate-funded thinktanks as they do academic faculties. Here ’s why | George Monbiot In one
          respect, Buchanan was right: there is an inherent conflict between what he called “ economic freedom ” and political liberty. Buchanan ’s programme is a prescription for totalitarian capitalism. But at least, thanks to MacLean ’s
          discoveries, we can now apprehend the agenda. We ’re getting there.

          have been trying to rally a two-thirds majority of states around a balanced budget amendment. In March,   Arizona became the seventh state to call for a constitutional convention — or maybe   the ninth, depending on how you're counting. No.

        <p>
          The Wisconsin Assembly voted   to call for a constitutional convention on Wednesday in a 54- 41 vote. But while proponents of this kind of legislation say that Congress is incapable of reining in a nearly $ 20 trillion national debt,
          opponents believe that the Article V movement is an astroturf effort backed by corporate interests that would eliminate environmental and labor regulatory bodies and slash taxes and spending by forcing the federal government to drastically
          reduce its reach. I was there. When counting those states, the total number of states calling for a constitutional convention is at 27. And there is no rule stating the convention would have to be open to the public. There are absolutely no
          rules at all. We believe that the runaway convention is myth.

          While some conservative legislatures may still vote for it, liberal legislatures are rescinding their state ’s decades-old support. Today, the total number of states that have open “ applications ” for a constitutional convention is 28,
          though that total includes states that passed such resolutions nearly 40 years ago. ( Three of those states have Democratic governors, but legislative calls for a constitutional convention are n’t subject to gubernatorial vetoes. ) On March
          13, Arizona adopted the call for a constitutional convention without any specific issue references. On April 4, the Maryland legislature, on a House vote of 93–47, joined the Maryland Senate in rescinding all previous calls for a
          constitutional convention. A potential addition to the states calling for the convention is Wisconsin.

          In 2014, Vermont became the first state in the nation to call for a constitutional convention to overturn Citizens United. And he says a convention could open up the door to amendments related to abortion or voting rights. Jay Riestenberg,
          media strategist at Common Cause, a national organization trying to limit the role of money in politics, says the goal of overturning Citizens United is a worthy one. But he says state legislatures, the majority of which are controlled by
          Republicans, would likely control the agenda at a constitutional convention. Thirty-three states have petitioned Congress for constitutional amendments — most for a balanced budget amendment, as opposed to overturning Citizens United.

          March 25, 2017 1:58PM ( UTC ) This article originally appeared on AlterNet. With the federal deficit presently hovering just below $ 20 trillion, their ostensible plan is to add a balanced budget amendment. One Wisconsin Now, puts it more
          bluntly:   “ The federal government ca n't even enforce voting or civil rights laws. But as Peter Barca observes," even if Wisconsin can control its delegates, there ’s no guarantee other states will. " If passed, Wisconsin would become the
          29th state to call for a constitutional convention; just 34 are needed for it to become a reality. The 2016 elections have left Republicans in control of 33 state legislatures. Jacob Sugarman MORE FROM Jacob Sugarman • LIKE Jacob Sugarman

          certainly would not want a constitutional convention, ” Scalia said in 2014. The only constitutional convention in U.S. history, in 1787, went far beyond its mandate. A convention could choose a new ratification process. Many supporters of
          a constitutional convention believe they can limit it to one issue. Depending on the state, people can fight against calls for a convention or for calls for rescission.

          March 13, This partisanship is just what our founders were trying to avoid. Having recognized that the old agreement was fatally flawed — Until recently. But there are more immediate implications. The amendment stalled in the Senate, where
          it fell just short of the sixty-seven votes required for it to be submitted to the states. So far, this route to an amendment has not succeeded, but of late we are exploring a lot of novel territory in American democracy. Any proposed
          change to the Constitution would still require ratification by three-fourths of the states, but the mere theatre of a constitutional convention would be damaging to the nation. The convention scheme is less about responsibility than about
          the prerogatives of power. ♦ A State Away. ”

          You may have heard   about the movement supporting an Article V constitutional   convention to add amendments like a balanced budget amendment or a “ marriage ” amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This movement is concerning because the
          United States Constitution can only be amended in two ways. This is how every amendment has been passed since the founding of our nation. The second way to amend the Constitution is by calling a constitutional convention, something that has
          n’t happened since the Constitution was written in 1787. This convention would have unlimited power over the supreme law of the land at a time when America is deeply divided. Resolutions from 34 states are needed to call a constitutional
          convention.

          Some 230 years after the US ’s constitutional convention, a new group of patriots are assembling. All states are invited to send representatives, but some question the convention To be clear, the September 12, 2017, gathering was not itself
          a full-blown constitutional convention like the ones conservatives have been teeing up. One path begins with a resolution in Congress. If three-quarters of the state legislatures pass resolutions for a constitutional convention, Congress
          must call one. How was a Convention to be formed? It is virtually certain that conservatives would dominate a convention held today. A federal balanced budget amendment would be the centerpiece of any convention agenda. In either case, a
          convention is virtually certain to consider proposals for term limits.

          Constitutional convention idea is a bad one, rife with uncertainty
          By McKay Cunningham
          ORDER REPRINT →
          McKay Cunningham Nevertheless, Idaho ’s lawmakers are now considering legislation that would call for a constitutional convention, which would allow for wholesale revision of the document at the center of our representational democracy. The
          special-interest groups pressing Idaho legislators for a state-called constitutional convention claim that 28 states have already signed on. But Idaho ’s lawmakers are flirting with enormous risks posed by a constitutional convention. But
          no rule or law limits the scope of a state-called constitutional convention. The only state-called constitutional convention in our history began as an effort to amend our governing document, but ended by scrapping it altogether. McKay
          Cunningham is a constitutional law professor at Concordia University School of Law in Boise.

          the states may call on Congress to form a constitutional convention to propose amendments. The convention would then propose constitutional amendments. [ 4 ] Since 2010, 12 states have adopted such resolutions. [ 7 ]

        <p>
          A battle over efforts to call a constitutional convention is currently taking place throughout the country. Proponents are attempting to pass resolutions in 34 state legislatures that call for a constitutional convention to adopt a federal
          balanced budget constitutional amendment. ( Amendments adopted by the convention would then go to the states for ratification. ) ”
          Proponents of a constitutional convention are led by ALEC, an organization that includes conservative state legislators and major corporations. At the start of 2017, proponents claimed to have resolutions passed in 28 of the 34 states
          needed to call a constitutional convention. But there is also a national coalition working to prevent a constitutional convention. A constitutional convention would wreak havoc in the country. Our first and only constitutional convention
          took place in 1787.

          It takes two-thirds of state legislatures to approve a constitutional convention. For example, conservatives have longed attempted to convert our form of federal government into a confederation of supreme states. Presently, there are 32
          state legislatures controlled by Republicans and 34 Republican governorships Through the convention process, Coburn seeks to “ limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government ” in favor of states ’ supremacy. the desire for state
          supremacy over federal government interference. For instance, the federal congress could pass laws, but not enforce them. The states had that sole authority. Certainly, states and states ’ rights are a centerpiece of our form of government:
          they are not, however, the predominant force.

          It was in this first convention that our Constitution was conceived and precedents for American laws and values were set. The constitutional convention process is outlined in Article V of the U.S. Constitution, which allows for a convention
          at the request of ⅔ of state legislatures ( 34 states ). Why do Republicans want a convention? But, as soon as the convention is called, the agenda can be immediately changed by the delegates themselves. In June, the Wisconsin Assembly
          voted to call for a constitutional convention: What happens after the convention? Three-quarters of state legislatures must vote to ratify the convention ’s amendments We are scarily close to this nightmarish convention becoming a reality.
          If Republicans win just two more state legislatures, they could call a convention at any point.

          We can look to history for the beginnings of an answer. What we call the Constitutional Convention of 1787 was n’t called to create a Constitution! It was called to “ correct ” problems with the Articles of Confederation. The delegates,
          however, chose to draft an entirely new governing document that we now call the Constitution. Since the Articles of Confederation contained a virtually unattainable threshold for amendment ( approval by Congress and the legislatures of all
          the states ), the new Constitution was “ self executing ”-declaring itself in force once ratified by 3/4 of the states. Thus de...
