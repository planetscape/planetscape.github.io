        <p>
          ( Since 1970, the United States has had a balanced budget in only four years: 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. ) But as of today, 28 states — six shy of the two-thirds threshold required by Article V — have passed resolutions calling for a
          constitutional convention to consider a balanced budget amendment. Convention of States advocates a constitutional convention to not only pass a balanced budget amendment, but also to curtail the “ power and jurisdiction of the federal
          government. In other words, if Convention of States has its way, there could well be a runaway convention. He describes the campaign for a constitutional convention as “ a very live threat. But such a convention is not the tonic to satiate
          this discontent.

          The GOP now holds numerical majorities in 33 legislatures, one shy of the two-thirds required to initiate a convention on constitutional amendments. By a two-thirds vote of each chamber, the U.S. House and Senate can refer an amendment to
          the states. Or two-thirds of the state legislatures can request that Congress call a convention of the states. Montana's Republican-led House overwhelmingly defeated a resolution calling for a convention on a balanced budget amendment when
          it last met in 2015. The states then ratified the amendment. Ivory was elected in September as the presiding officer of a simulated convention of the states designed to demonstrate that the method of proposing constitutional amendments
          actually can work.

          Story highlights How hard would that be? What is a constitutional convention? We've already had one constitutional convention-- literally The Constitutional Convention, in 1787, which gave us the Constitution-- and there has n't been one
          since. This is why some lawmakers and constitutional experts are apprehensive about re- opening the Constitution, via a convention: anything could go. The Making of the United States Constitution. Jones, with ALEC, said that any successful
          petitioning of Congress would result in a" convention of the states" and not, specifically, a broad-sweeping constitutional convention.

          Image A clause in Article 5 of the Constitution allows for states to sidestep Congress and draft amendments. either by their legislatures or by state conventions — to take effect. ’ ’ Amendment conventions are not exclusively a conservative
          cause. Article 5 places no limits on a convention ’s power. So what rules would an amendments convention follow? Conventions of states, they say, are nothing new: — A convention to draft amendments, they say, would be no different. But even
          if it did, he said, he would not be especially concerned: After all, a convention only proposes amendments. “ ”

          That fear over federal overreach is justified. Instead of relying on politicians in Washington, Americans should use the power they already have to push the federal government back within its constitutional bounds. That ’s why they gave
          states the ability to restrain the federal government through the amendment process. Amendments proposed at this convention would then be subject to ratification by three-fourths of all states. Simply put, state legislatures can call a
          convention to propose an amendment regardless of what Congress wants. there is a significant chance that an amendments convention will meet within the next few years. ”
          Governor Greg Abbott of Texas expressed his support for a convention of states to propose Constitutional amendments that would realign the federal government with the will of the people. Those are two promising antidotes for the poison of
          federal overreach.

          Four liberal states — California, Vermont, Illinois, and New Jersey — have signed on to this idea. Here ’s why that ’s a terrible idea. On the right, the longstanding proposal for a convention to draft a balanced budget amendment has at
          times come within striking distance of the requisite two-thirds of state legislatures needed to trigger the idea. Some of these ideas are better than others — Gov. Hence Justice Antonin Scalia ’s brusque dismissal: I certainly would not
          want a constitutional convention. Go ahead and read the instruction kit for a convention, such as it is, in Article V of the U.S. Constitution. It ’s quite brief. It says not a word expressly authorizing the states, Congress, or some
          combination of the two to confine the subject matter of a convention.

          Do we need a constitutional convention on campaign finance? The U.S. Supreme Court in June of 2015. Does the United States need a constitutional amendment to clean up the campaign finance mess created by the U.S. Supreme Court? My answer is
          absolutely not. In the 2010 case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down on 1st Amendment It is much easier to... appoint different justices to the Supreme Court than it is to follow the formal
          paths to constitutional convention and amendment. Another path to change is a constitutional convention. If it did, it would n't have called for a constitutional convention back in 2014. "
