          to Repeal the 17th Amendment The 17th article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Section 2. One only needs to examine the electoral map to understand why ALEC is pushing for a repeal of the 17th
          Amendment now. Only Utah has passed a resolution urging the repeal of the 17th Amendment. The result? ALEC has debated the repeal of the 17th Amendment before at the 2013 States and Nation Policy Summit. The Act did not call for a repeal of
          the 17th Amendment, but gave a leg up to a favored candidate.

          one billionaire family has stepped into the void to quietly become one of the most powerful players in conservative politics. In the topsy-turvy world of Trump ’s G.O.P., Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer and
          heir to his billion-dollar fortune, has emerged as the new center of the conservative universe, Politico reports, pouring millions into a sustained effort to bolster the Republican nominee ’s campaign and remake the party in his image. Get

          the select members of ALEC ’s corporate board for almost twenty years. The company ’s top lobbyist was once ALEC ’s chairman. Dozens of other ALEC bills would limit environmental regulations or litigation in ways that would benefit Koch.
          Several pieces of ALEC ’s model legislation echo this plan. ” “ ALEC and the Kochs often pursue parallel tracks. But ALEC also operates like an arm of the Koch agenda, circulating bills that make their vision of the world concrete.

          The two perennial anti- union bills were last introduced in Congress by Rep. Steve King ( R-IA ) in 2017. So-called" right to work" laws are actually designed to weaken unions and lower wages, as the Economic Policy Institute has reported.
          Shortly after, Vukmir introduced an ALEC-style repeal of Wisconsin's prevailing wage law for public projects. In 2016, ALEC National Chair Vukmir" authored" yet another attack on workers, introducing an ALEC model bill prohibiting project
          labor agreements. Project labor agreements encourage union representation and better wages and working conditions on public works projects. In 2014, Vukmir received a" Working for Wisconsin" award from the group. " Learn more about NRTWC

          We are probably the world ’s largest e-commerce company you have never heard about. Alibaba ’s decision to join the powerful legislation-writing organization comes as many Chinese companies have entered the U.S. market and stepped up their
          influence in domestic politics. Executives involved in the   transaction denied the Chinese government ’s involvement in the sale. A spokesperson for Heinz emailed The Intercept to say Heinz had “ no financial interest or investment ” in
          the deal undertaken in China. It ’s not clear which of ALEC ’s “ model ” bills Alibaba has sought to influence. Alibaba ’s Anaya was brought to the summit in Nashville by an ALEC staffer involved in the group ’s actions on minimum wage
          issues. U.S. companies sell and export their goods into China.

          ” So ALEC is trying to backdoor these rollbacks by calling for a first ever Article V constitutional convention to cut federal spending and limit federal authority. ALEC ’s Article V constitutional convention push is really a hissy fit of
          the far right. ALEC ’s real goal is preventing the federal government from providing health care and most other things in the first place. The BBAT wants a convention to adopt amendments specifically requiring a federal balance budget.
          Twelve states have passed resolutions calling for this type of constitutional convention. ” “ The COS folks believe that the authority of the federal government is the disease which must be cured, and the spending is but a symptom.

          The right-wing legislative lobbying group ALEC has been losing corporate members at a remarkable pace since 2012, due in part to its support of measures attacking   clean energy, workers rights and voting rights. That makes the appearance
          of AARP on the list of sponsors of ALEC's 2016 annual meeting last month all the more curious. AARP is n't exactly hiding its new financial relationship with ALEC. The Koch-affiliated ALEC — the name stands for Fla. After Florida enacted
          its measure, it was translated into an ALEC model and passed in 16 more states. Backlash against ALEC began in 2011, just as its influence among state legislators was reaching its peak. ALEC has n't responded to our request for comment. It
          would be wise for AARP to follow that model.

          By Earlier this year I posted about ALEC ’s stealth constitutional convention, purportedly to propose a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution that if it were ever actually adopted would wreak economic havoc on the U.S. economy.
          So naturally the Tea-Publicans in the Arizona House were all for it Then they did it again in a strike everything amendment to Cap’n Al Melvin ’s bill, SCR 1016 (.pdf ). All of these ALEC model bills died in the Arizona Senate where Senate
          President Andy Biggs, who is no fan of Article V conventions, made certain that these bills never came up for a final vote. Andy Biggs — just this once.

          Alec has identified more than 40 lapsed corporate members. But Alec's senior director of public affairs, Bill Meierling, insisted that the group complies with all state and federal tax laws. Meierling insisted that Alec does not lobby in
          any state. Alec's own internal records of its membership states that it has 1,810 state legislators on its membership books – The documents show that Alec has struggled to hold on to members from the financial services industry. A total of
          41 companies are listed by Alec as targets to be lured back into membership. But Alec said that the draft agreement was not adopted by the membership committee or by any of the state chairs. We believe they would have a strong interest in
          Alec. The Alec board, consisting solely of state legislators, rejected the gambling plan.

          ALEC is a 501 c3 non-profit organization. According to the group: "It is the nation's largest nonpartisan (sic) individual membership association of state legislators (sic), with nearly 2,000 members across the nation and more than 100

          When I joined ALEC eight years ago, it was a very different organization, ” Vick said in a statement. So what is ALEC, and why is it causing such a fuss? While legislators pay $ 50 a year to belong to the group, most of the ALEC ’s money
          comes from corporations. Criticism, an ALEC spokeswoman said, is inspired by the group ’s conservative philosophy, not its methods. The group created a new website, ALEC Exposed, to house the drafts and publicize ALEC ’s work. “ Part of
          ALEC ’s modus operandi was to operate behind the scenes without a lot of visibility. It ’s getting that visibility now. ” But ALEC ’s critics are not satisfied.

        <p>
          Our nation is trillions of dollars in debt without a credible plan to stop spending. The battle in Congress has escalated to a point where politics outweighs the cost of our economic future, and there is little hope our nation ’s leaders
          will make the tough choices that need to be made in order to reign in our debt and revive our economy. Balancing our budget transcends party politics. No matter who controls Congress or the presidency, our $ 15 trillion dollar ( and growing
          ) national debt will remain an ever-present hurdle to economic growth and recovery. Today America faces an uncertain economic future. State legislators must take the long-sighted view and exercise our rights within the Constitution to limit
          Congress ’s ability to drive our nation into further economic decay.

          meetings in 2009. But ALEC membership does provide other rewards for legislators. How Much Do These ALEC Conventions Cost? ALEC conventions cost about $ 2 million a year, but only bring in about $ 850,000 in revenue. What Else Does ALEC Do

        <p>
          Hundreds of ALEC ’s model bills and resolutions bear traces of Koch DNA: raw ideas that were once at the fringes ALEC gave the Kochs its Adam Smith Free Enterprise Award, and Koch Industries has been one of the select members of ALEC ’s
          corporate board for almost twenty years. The company ’s top lobbyist was once ALEC ’s chairman. Dozens of other ALEC bills would limit environmental regulations or litigation in ways that would benefit Koch. ALEC ’s model legislation
          reflects parts of the Kochs ’ agenda that have little to do with oil profits. Long before ALEC started pushing taxpayer-subsidized school vouchers, for example, the Koch fortune was already underwriting attacks on public education. Several
          pieces of ALEC ’s model legislation echo this plan. ALEC and the Kochs often pursue parallel tracks.

          ALEC's Attack on Public Education
          08/01/2017 The issue of the moment for ALEC is public education — that is, undermining it. Fittingly, the keynote speaker at ALEC ’s July 19- 21 conference was school privatization czarina Betsy DeVos. DeVos has spent most of her life using
          her billions to push privatizing public education through charter and voucher school schemes. I heard repeatedly ( perhaps because of the millions of dollars the school privatization industry Her priority, and ALEC ’s agenda, are otherwise.
          It ’s no longer about low-income students in low-performing schools. What you never hear at ALEC is any discussion about improving public education. To DeVos, those who support public schools are “ supporters of the status quo. ” But
          Children, as most attend public schools that ALEC members want to unravel.

          I know because I am a Wisconsin legislator, and a member of ALEC. We were given a model Article V constitutional convention resolution, urged to save the Republic, and sent on our way. His resolution, which would make Wisconsin the 30th
          state calling for a Constitutional Convention to propose a balanced budget amendment, will soon be considered by the Wisconsin legislature. ALEC is a driving force behind this austerity movement, supplying model bills, “ how to ” books, and
          support for pro- amendment groups. That sums up ALEC. To them, government is not about the people, but the most powerful doing what they want, when they want, and to whom they want.

          ALEC exists specifically so that lobbyists and corporations can influence state legislative   policies away from public view. With help from corporate political contributions, lobbyists then help move the legislation forward. Increasingly
          however, that ’s not thecase and corporate lobbyists, not our legislators, are drafting Minnesota ’s laws. In Minnesota, at least 19 legislators are members of ALEC ’s legislative task forces. Protecting Corporate Tax Breaks in the

          Minnesota spent over $ 24.3 billion

          James McGill Buchanan is a name you will rarely hear unless you ’ve taken several classes in economics. MacLean could not gain access to Buchanan ’s papers to test her hypothesis until after his death in January 2013. Buchanan vehemently
          disagreed Buchanan ’s view of human nature was distinctly dismal. It did to Buchanan. a precursor of modern public choice theory ” who “ anticipates ” Buchanan ’s thinking. But the Virginia school ’s focus and career missions were distinct.
          Buchanan ’s school focused on public choice theory, later adding constitutional economics and the new field of law and economics to its core research and advocacy. It was n’t. Buchanan was not a dystopian novelist. Research like MacLean ’s
          provides hope that toxic ideas like Buchanan ’s may finally begin to face public scrutiny.

        <p>
          To read Nancy MacLean ’s new book, Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right ’s Stealth Plan for America, is to see what was previously invisible. The programme is now reshaping politics, and not just in the US. MacLean
          says that Charles Koch poured millions into Buchanan ’s work at George Mason University, whose law and economics departments look as much like corporate-funded thinktanks as they do academic faculties. Here ’s why | George Monbiot In one
          respect, Buchanan was right: there is an inherent conflict between what he called “ economic freedom ” and political liberty. Buchanan ’s programme is a prescription for totalitarian capitalism. But at least, thanks to MacLean ’s
          discoveries, we can now apprehend the agenda. We ’re getting there.

          ties to Cambridge Analytica saying Cruz benefited from a “ Massive invasion of privacy ” and “ deceitful activity ”. The response by Cruz Campaign Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier therefore, that they relied on Cambridge Analytica ’s
          assurances not to invade people Nobody is faulting the Cruz Campaign for relying on Cambridge Analytica ’s assurances. At that time Cambridge Analytica was still in Cruz ’s corner as he tried to fend off then candidate Donald Trump from
          scoring an upset victory in Texas. The DNC / Texas Dems should really explore a federal lawsuit against the Cruz Campaign.

          Former Sen. Jim DeMint speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2017. — Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint was in Charleston Monday, pushing members of the House of Delegates to support a movement calling for a
          convention of states for amending the U.S. Constitution. DeMint serves as a senior adviser for the Convention of States Project, a nationwide organization pushing state legislatures to agree to hold a national convention, in which
          constitutional amendments would be proposed to limit the powers and spending of the federal government. Twelve states have already passed resolutions supporting a convention of states. DeMint said a bill calling for a convention needs 51
          sponsors in the House of Delegates before it could head to a floor vote. “

          have been trying to rally a two-thirds majority of states around a balanced budget amendment. In March,   Arizona became the seventh state to call for a constitutional convention — or maybe   the ninth, depending on how you're counting. No.

          ’s time for the states to take power themselves, says DeMint. If 33 states call for a convention of states, Article V is triggered, and the process of amending the Constitution begins. Three-fourths of the several states — 38 states — must
          ratify any amendment proposed by convention delegates. So far, 12 states have adopted resolutions calling for a convention of states. DeMint will travel to North Carolina later this month on behalf of the Convention of States Project to
          encourage the state House to follow the state Senate ’s lead in passing a resolution calling for a convention of states. Should the House do so, North Carolina will become the 13th state to call for a convention to amend the Constitution. ”

          By Alexander Bolton-12/06/12 ADVERTISEMENT I ’m leaving the Senate now, but I ’m not leaving the fight. DeMint's decision to leave the Senate after only eight years shocked Washington. DeMint had been seen as a future Senate leader for his

          classrooms. ” Well, we do n’t want that, do we? This is to education as the infamous Wedge Document was to science: an embarrassing, religiously motivated plan of action that was removed from the Internet because it clearly conflicted with
          secular public education. ” So we do n’t know, and — just as it was worthwhile knowing about the Wedge Document. Some have joked that the new logo for the Department of Education would be the one below, but that ’s a bit premature:

          The DeVos family has been promoting and funding efforts to" Christianize" public education for more than twenty years. In the DeVos' personal worldview, public schools inappropriately vie with religion for the hearts and minds of students.
          " All in all, the DeVos family pumped more than $ 44 million into Michigan Republican campaign committees and candidates between 1997 and 2012, and followed that up with another $ 8.3 million in Michigan's 2014 and 2016 elections. And
          that's just what was disclosed. In Detroit, Snyder used state control to defund public schools and allow a" Wild West" of charter schools to spring up. Detroit parents lost their democratic rights, while unelected managers closed two-thirds
          of their schools.

          FREE describes its policy seminars for federal judges. James Paine, Fla.; S. Jay Plager, Federal Circuit. Robert Yock, Federal Claims. Federal judges are some of America's most important environmental decision-makers," he said. Two major
          sources of FREE attendees are the U.S. Court of Claims and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. These courts are specialized bodies that hear most property rights cases against the federal government. This is heavy-duty stuff.
          "
          FREE is not the only group that sponsors judicial seminars. Nearly 40 percent of the federal judiciary have attended the seminars. so there's a potential conflict. " That would be grossly counterproductive, I think. " ©

          About 5 percent of all federal judges attend a FREE seminar each year, the foundation said. The report also criticizes a lawyer who briefly served on the foundation's board. That lawyer, Edward W. Warren, of the Washington office of
          Kirkland &amp; Ellis, joined the board while an important environmental case in which he was lead counsel for an industry group was pending in the federal appeals court in Washington. We are continually improving the quality of our text

          Washington Post Staff Writer " Paul Weyrich was conservative long, long before it was cool," said American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene. More than any person, perhaps excluding President Ronald Reagan, whom he attacked as
          insufficiently conservative, Weyrich stitched the religious, social-issue voters into the secular fabric of the Republican Party. His Free Congress Foundation virtually invented the use of grass-roots direct-mail fundraising campaigns for
          conservative politicians and social causes. At a 1979 gathering of religious leaders, Weyrich talked about a" moral majority" of American voters. A blunt speaker who created enemies even among those who agreed with him, Weyrich was called"
          the Robespierre of the right" and a" pillar of the modern conservative movement. " "

          Here is the real problem. It has been known for many years that Congressman Foley was a homosexual. Homosexuals tend to be preoccupied with sex. It happens to be true. That is your opinion. See ya, Paul. Do n't let Silicon Valley control

        <p>
          Speaking on a panel about the Constitution during the 2018 Bradley Symposium at the Heritage Foundation, Kesler promoted a conservative originalist approach to the 18th Century Constitution: He described one Constitution, the original 1787
          document as amended, as steeped in natural rights and limited government. This one, he said, is also the “ conservatives ’ Constitution. ” The other one is the “ living Constitution, ” or what he called “ the liberals ’ Constitution. ”
          Kesler said that a “ cold civil war ” broke out when conservatives fought back:
          The conservatives who began an epic campaign against the inevitable emergency of the living Constitution had in common the desire, the duty to oppose the gradual disappearance of limited government from American political life.

          White supremacists vowed “ massive resistance, ” with Virginia ’s Prince Edward County going so far as to shutter its entire public school system for several years. That ’s where the intellectual antihero of MacLean ’s book, James Buchanan,
          comes in. In 1959, the fire-breathing libertarian theorists at UVA thrust themselves into the heart of Virginia ’s desegregation battle by proposing a now-familiar libertarian ploy: privatization of the state ’s public schools. After
          Buchanan had a falling out with Koch in 1998, the hack libertarian economist Tyler Cowen kept hammering away at the Buchananite gospel from his perch atop George Mason ’s Koch-funded Mercatus Institute.

          The Greenhouse 100 index ranks Southern Company, Duke Energy and American Electric Power as top greenhouse gas emitters. Topping the list of air polluters are Zachry Group, DowDuPont and Berkshire Hathaway. Topping the list of water
          polluters are DowDuPont, American Electric Power and Honeywell International. The Greenhouse 100 Index ranks companies by 2015 direct emissions from large sources. The top three companies, Southern Company, Duke Energy, and American
          Electric Power, each released over 100 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions in 2015. The Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index includes an environmental justice report card showing companies' pollution burden on minority and low-income
          communities. Minorities bear disproportionate risk from eight of the top ten companies. DowDuPont, American Electric Power, and Honeywell International top the Toxic 100 Water index for 2015.

          The index uses the newest data from EPA analysis of air and water releases of hundreds of chemicals from thousands of industrial facilities across the U.S.   Topping the list of air polluters are Alcoa and Dupont corporations. Topping the
          list of air polluters are Alcoa and Dupont corporations, while Dow Chemical and American Electric Power top the list of water polluters. We assess not just how many pounds of pollutants are released, but which are the most toxic. The data
          on toxic chemical releases come from the EPA ’s Toxics Release Inventory ( TRI ). In addition to TRI data, the EPA ’s RSEI includes toxicity weights for both air and water releases. For water pollution, the Toxic 100 rankings are based on
          the RSEI Hazard, which is total pounds released weighted by chemical toxicity.

          • Greenpeace ’s attempt to lift the veil of secrecy inherent to a private company like Koch Industries is no easy task. That intentional secrecy allows Koch Industries, the second-largest privately-held company in the United States, to fly
          largely below the public ’s radar. Charles G. and David H. Koch, two of Fred ’s four sons, each now own 42 % of the company ’s stock. During the 2008 elections, Koch Industries contributed over $ 1.8 million, 88 % to Republican candidates.
          Koch Industries has bankrolled Americans for Prosperity to the tune of over $ 5 million since 2005. ” ” More attention needs to be paid to Koch Industries, and this report will hopefully encourage deeper investigation into the Koch web ’s
          confusion   campaign.

          The relationship between Donald Trump and the Koch brothers has gone from chilly to warm. A Public Citizen review of the Koch brothers ’ connections to the Trump administration and policy agenda in Washington, D.C. finds:
          44 Trump administration officials have close ties to the Koch brothers and their network of political groups, particularly Vice President Mike Pence, White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and
          White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. The bulk of Koch allies are in the White House, with 21 officials working there or nominated for White House jobs.

          Koch-backed group to target some Republicans over spending vote in new ad campaign
          By Jonathan Easley-05/23/18 08:35 PM EDT A conservative group backed by billionaire donors Charles and David Koch is preparing to launch a six-figure ad campaign targeting Republican and Democratic lawmakers who voted for the $ 1.3 trillion
          spending package in March. Americans for Prosperity will drop the radio, print, digital and direct mail ads in the lawmaker ’s districts as they arrive home for Memorial Day weekend. Lawmakers passed the massive spending bill but have
          failed to move on the Koch network ’s legislative priorities, such as immigration reform. The $ 1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. The Republicans who will
          be targeted by the ad campaign are Reps. Hal Rogers

          all as you can see from the featured image, abolishing Medicare and Medicaid was House Speaker Ryan ’s rare moment of candor is to date the clearest evidence as to GOP ’s real intentions with Medicare and Medicaid. Which is why as we
          approach Midterms 2018 Dems must expose the GOP / Koch Brothers / ALEC ’s radical mission to eliminate Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; Social Security all under the guise of a “ Balanced Budget Amendment. ”

          One of those tactics is the opt-out campaign. Access to lists of union members is essential to this project. The toolkit is being circulated at a vital moment for public sector trade unions. More perilously, the US supreme court is poised

          How Koch Brothers Paid Gov Abbott To Pollute Texas Well, not the Texas GOP. The Chemical Safety Board suggested that Texas do better on chemical disclosure to avert another chemical disaster. However, a few months after the West disaster
          the Koch family sent then Texas AG Greg Abbott “ donations ” for his Texas Gubernatorial bid and just like that all the chemical disclosure reforms that were suggested by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board went out the window. Fast forward to
          2017 and a similar chemical disaster happens, this time at the Archema Chemical Plant   in Crosby, Texas after Hurricane Harvey. whether the Koch Brothers like it or not Dems must expose how Governor Abbott and other Texas Republicans have
          sacrificed the public ’s safety for the enrichment of their Super Donor Koch Brothers.

          Dangerous Koch Brothers Are Out To Change The Koch Brothers not only heavily fund ALEC, they sit on its Board. So what exactly does ALEC do? This is so repugnant because the Koch Brothers literally use ALEC to subvert the will of the people
          ( Democracy ). But subverting Democracy is by no means the end of ALEC / Koch Brothers ’ radical agenda. The Koch Brothers through ALEC are currently mobilizing Republican-controlled states(with GOP majorities in state legislature ) to call
          for a Convention of States, a rarely used Constitutional mechanism that can be used to change the U.S. Constitution. As for now folks just remember that the Koch Brothers with their outfit ALEC are up to no good and we need to watch them.

          21 current or nominated White House officials with close ties to the Koch, according to the Public Citizen report, with Short being perhaps the most closely linked. But as soon as Trump was elected, the Koch network saw an opportunity to

          16012 The billionaire Koch Brothers are some of the worst polluters in U.S. history. But thanks to Trump handing the Koch's wide network free reign in the American government, the right-wing brothers will be able to pollute and profit at an
          increased rate. The Koch's political operation recently disseminated a report in which the group" takes credit for more than a dozen new policies" put in place by the Trump administration, according to McClatchy reporting. There are at
          least 44 Trump administration officials with close ties to the Kochs and their affiliated groups. The Trump administration has utter disdain for common sense environmental regulation and policy, and the Koch Brothers network loves it.

          by Colin Kalmbacher The Charles Koch Foundation is slated to fund a new Facebook initiative and commission dedicated to exploring the role social media played in the 2016 U.S. presidential and general elections. A lengthy status update
          posted by Facebook ’s Mark Zuckerberg   early Monday morning outlined the new commission ’s objective. Zuckerberg did describe the new commission ’s methodology in his own words. As noted, one of those foundations is the   Charles G. Koch
          Charitable Foundation – a 501(c)(3 ) non- profit founded in 1980 and dedicated to advancing the conservative-libertarian politics of the organization ’s founder. For a thorough but non- exhaustive list of Charles Koch ’s contributions and
          priorities in recent years, see here.

          conservative idea of the limited role of government, best explained by this quote from the lesson on “ The Limited Role of Government ”:
          Perhaps the most definitive limitations on government are found in the Bill of Rights. ” Federalism: How Obamacare is indicative of big government. Again, these lessons are reaching millions of children across America. Furthermore, most
          school districts do n’t have the time or the manpower to closely examine every single teacher ’s lesson plan. Even the online lesson plans are tailored to the education standards for each state.

          The Koch political network has funneled money and organizing into state politics for some time, contributing to huge state legislative gains by Republicans over the last decade. Since 2010, Republicans have gained control of 18 additional
          state legislatures. To complement super PAC spending and campaign contributions, the Koch political network also spent millions of dollars on outside advertisements in state races. And the Koch network is embedded in the ALEC leadership.
          Koch Industries donated nearly $ 60,000 directly to Virginia state campaigns last year, including $ 20,000 to Gillespie, $ 10,000 to Adams and $ 7,500 to the Dominion Leadership Trust. In addition to privatizing education and cutting taxes,
          the Koch network has plenty of other designs for the states.

          insisted that it dallies in politics as a means to push policy. Consider that stage that brought together Cruz, Scarface and Carlos on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This network does, ” said Evan Feinberg, who leads the venture-philanthropy

          Prosperity told reporters Saturday. This includes up to $ 20 million on “ communicating the benefits of tax reform," along with other policy and politics efforts. The network spent about $ 250 million on policy and politics in the 2016
          cycle. Why this matters: Midterm elections are typically very difficult for the party in power, even without the scandals that have occurred under the Trump administration. The network sees the regulatory and legislative victories of the
          administration as hugely important and are going all-out to protect them.

          At the moment, Draper is promoting a new referendum on the possibility of dividing California into three states. This sounds a bit like what Schumacher is up to when he talks about his deregulated sovereign area and how it ’s for people who

        <p>
          The political network affiliated with billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch will launch a multimillion-dollar campaign to sell the just-passed GOP tax plan to voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. " Already this year, Koch
          network officials say they have hosted more than 100 events across 36 states on the new tax policy, knocked on more than 33,000 doors, reached nearly 2 million activists, and spent about $ 8 million on ad spending. Earlier this year, the
          network aggressively opposed the initial House GOP-led effort to implement a" border adjustment tax", even though Charles and David Koch would have financially gained from the legislation. “ "

          David Koch
          Scott Eells / Bloomberg / Getty Images — the Koch brothers are fighting low-cost open fiber nets. It's a city of about 750,000, the largest in the state. The city estimated that if it installed fiber for city use from scratch, it would cost
          $ 15 million. All for just the cost of the fiber lines. It seemed to be a no-brainer. Suddenly, the city's eminently sensible plan was in trouble. Then Simrall and the city found out that the Washington, DC-based Taxpayers Protection
          Alliance had been posting frequently on social media opposing Louisville's fiber plan. “ Google suspended its fiber efforts in many cities due to cost-now wants Louisville taxpayers to foot the $ 5.4 M bill.

          To read Nancy MacLean ’s new book, Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right ’s Stealth Plan for America, is to see what was previously invisible. The programme is now reshaping politics, and not just in the US. MacLean
          says that Charles Koch poured millions into Buchanan ’s work at George Mason University, whose law and economics departments look as much like corporate-funded thinktanks as they do academic faculties. Here ’s why | George Monbiot In one
          respect, Buchanan was right: there is an inherent conflict between what he called “ economic freedom ” and political liberty. Buchanan ’s programme is a prescription for totalitarian capitalism. But at least, thanks to MacLean ’s
          discoveries, we can now apprehend the agenda. We ’re getting there.

          Koch Brothers Bankroll Move to Rewrite the Constitution
          A constitutional convention A constitutional convention, something thought impossible not long ago, is looking increasingly likely. There are two major legislative pushes for a convention at the state level. But once a convention is
          underway, all bets are off. The convention can write its own rules, resulting in a wide-open or A convention could even choose an entirely new ratification process. Will states withdraw their approval? ” The Koch agenda has not changed much
          since. Both TPPF and Empower Texans back the constitutional convention idea. In 2011, ALEC commissioned a handbook for state legislators on how to push for a constitutional convention. In 2015, ALEC ’s board of directors officially endorsed
          CSG ’s open convention plan as a “ model ” bill. “

          chose to switch Flint ’s water from Detroit ’s source of Lake Huron to the Flint River. In Michigan, another family has been throwing its money around to support an ideological agenda that led to the Flint water crisis. So, Flint is no

          residents in the city struggle to find drinkable water, the National Guard has been deployed to help distribute bottled water to   residents. The high salinity of this water caused the city ’s pipes to begin eroding, which then leached lead
          into the city ’s   water. The entire problem could have been avoided at a cost to the city of less than $ 100 per day.

          conservative billionaires who have spent heavily on political causes, she focuses mainly on Charles and David Koch. Charles and David Koch are hated by Democrats and loved by Republicans. By Jane Mayer

          I love a good fight between bad entities, which is why I ’m enjoying the brawl that ’s taking place between the Koch Brothers and the Republican Party. It was the vision that guided David Koch ’s 1980 vice-presidential bid, as Vermont
          Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders noted in April 2014:
          In 1980, David Koch ran as the Libertarian Party ’s vice-presidential candidate in 1980. Here are just a few excerpts of the Libertarian Party platform that David Koch ran on in 1980: We demand the return of America ’s railroad system to
          private ownership. “ We support the repeal of all state usury laws. ” Since libertarianism is an assault on our country ’s protections and principles, one can not be both a libertarian and a patriot. Which side are you on?

          that was an extreme view of a fringe party that had the support of 1 percent of the American people. For some, this means major cuts in Social Security. " " Here is what every American should be deeply concerned about. And let's be very

          7.3k More than half of the country has no idea who the Koch brothers are. That was the news from a George Washington University Battleground poll released Tuesday morning. Koch Zero? In fact, the GW Battleground survey, conducted by a
          bipartisan team of pollsters, does n't show that" people do n't know who the Koch brothers are. Of course, Democratic strategists would like it very much if more of the country knew who the Koch brothers are. To get a sense of how the Koch
          brothers stack up as campaign kindling, it also helps to look at past polls.

          Heavy oil is part of the Koch family heritage. He also wrote that Koch is one of the largest holders of oil sands assets in Alberta. In 1998, Koch also established a presence in Hardisty, Alberta, an oil transport hub. Even after these

          How the Koch Brothers Tried to Segregate Wake County Schools The billionaire brothers backed local candidates to take down an effort to integrate the country's 18th largest school district. In 2009, Americans for Prosperity, a group founded
          and funded by the Koch Brothers, funded the campaigns for the election of four Wake County school board seat candidates that supported the end to a program that integrated schools in the country ’s 18th largest school   district. Wake
          County schools were the first in the nation to adopt a program that would integrate schools based on class by mandating no more than 40 percent of students at any given school be on subsidized lunch programs. ’ documentary, available
          online, looks at how Americans for Prosperity is helping school board members using racially coded language end integration in schools.

        <p>A short animation detailing the effort of billionaires oil barons Charles & David Koch to undermine belief in climate change and prevent legislation that threatens their profits. By pouring money into bogus scientific studies and funding
          third parties such as Think Tanks and Front Groups (posing as everything from Seniors groups to Women's groups) the public is led to believe a genuine scientific debate is raging. In truth, as one climate denier candidly admits, those
          doubting the science are just a small, if brilliantly coordinated, minority. The piece was made by Australian filmmaker Taki Oldham and incorporates footage from his 55 min. documentary The Billionaires' Tea Party (2011). Big thanks to the
          visual effects team at Hungry Beast (hungrybeast.abc.net.au) for their advice and visual inspiration as well to the team at Greenpeace for their great research on the Koch Brothers (greenpeace.org/kochindustries).

          If you can destroy social security, you will have gone a long way forward in that effort. Koch Industries spent $ 857,000 on lobbyists in 2004, one year before George W Bush tried and failed to privatise social security. The attacks on
          social security needed more time to stew in the echo chamber before they could be mainstream, and given the increase in lobbyists, they have risen dramatically. The Koch brothers' echo chamber has successfully written the messaging for the
          AARP, a traditional defender of social security for all generations, which recently opened the door to cutting benefits. These Koch ideas percolate through the echo chamber and into the mainstream. Almost overnight, it seems, a historic and
          popular public service like social security faces extinction.

        <p>
          Harry Koch    [ 1867- 1942 ] Harry Koch was a Dutch immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1888, on the first New Amsterdam, the flagship of the well-known Holland America Line. The nearest one with a Dutch immigrant community was
          Chicago. Harry was good at both. Harry ’s Quanah job had one new twist to it. He was named John Anton Koch [ 1898- 1956 ], clearly a Dutch name. His name was Fred Chase Koch [ 1900- 1967 ], the founder of the Koch industrial empire and the
          father of the four Koch brothers. Harry in his paper Harry was not his birth name. The above explained the somewhat German sounding name of Koch.

          favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system. We support the eventual repeal of all taxation. “ We support the repeal of all state usury laws. ”

          An interesting March 20, 2018 piece by The Dallas Morning News however has raised questions about the role Cambridge Analytica played in Ted Cruz ’s Presidential Campaign. In the article members of the Texas Democratic Party blasted Cruz ’s
          ties to Cambridge Analytica saying Cruz benefited from a “ Massive invasion of privacy ” and “ deceitful activity ”. The response by Cruz Campaign Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier therefore, that they relied on Cambridge Analytica ’s
          assurances not to invade people Nobody is faulting the Cruz Campaign for relying on Cambridge Analytica ’s assurances. At that time Cambridge Analytica was still in Cruz ’s corner as he tried to fend off then candidate Donald Trump from
          scoring an upset victory in Texas. The DNC / Texas Dems should really explore a federal lawsuit against the Cruz Campaign.

          The Mercer Map-An Indispensable Tool In The Dem Toolkit It is a well known political fact that behind every GOP agenda item, there ’s either the Koch or Mercer family pulling strings from behind the scenes. These two families literally run
          the GOP and now the U.S. given the fact that the GOP is the party in power. Yours Truly therefore thought grassroots Democrats would find this Mercer Map handy when analyzing news items about the GOP. Any time grassroots Dems want to get
          the big picture on any GOP agenda item, all they have to do is look at the Mercer Map and see how it all fits together
          Hang in there folks. Yours Truly will try and get a Koch Brothers Map to give an even clearer picture of the forces behind any GOP agenda item.

          We may never know how much money billionaire Robert Mercer put into political activity during the 2016 election cycle. Mercer gave $ 2 million. We know that Mercer spent more than $ 49 million in 2016 ( and the 2016 election cycle ). More
          on that in a bit. An additional $ 25 million was donated to the Mercer Family Foundation. The Mercers, you may recall, switched to Trump in the middle of 2016. The campaign then started using Cambridge Analytica, Mercer ’s data firm, to
          supplement its voter outreach and hired Kellyanne Conway from Keep the Promise. ( Bolton ’s PAC spent some of that money on Cambridge Analytica as well. ) The $ 2 million spent on Secure America We do n’t Each, though, was engaged in 2016
          politics.

          Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire daughter of Robert Mercer — who has been dubbed the “ reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency ” —came out of hiding on Wednesday night with a rare op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. That ’s
          what makes the WSJ op-ed particularly interesting. Here ’s What I Believe, ” it ’s a clear attempt by Rebekah Mercer to reform her image by supposedly being candid about her views. But there is one line in Mercer ’s op-ed that is telling.
          In regards to her strategy, Mercer writes: “ That latter goal is, of course, what Rebekah Mercer and her family want, despite what she might say.

          interesting to me that Trump made this decision. And that's what he did. And that's very much the influence of Bannon. And of course, he is now Trump's strategic adviser.

          Robert Mercer, the co- CEO of the giant hedge fund manager Renaissance Technologies, appears to have financed the ad campaign entirely himself, through a $ 1 million contribution on July 26 to the New York State Conservative Party,
          according to a filing today by the party's housekeeping account. Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long confirmed to Haberman that Mercer was the source of the ad money. Mercer had maxed out to the account of Rick Lazio, but the Conservative
          Party's ads firmly attached the issue to Lazio and kept it top of mind in August in New York.

          This is one of three mock travel ads. More importantly, most voters never saw the ads. However, when OpenSecrets called to request a 2016 return, an unredacted return was provided by the group ’s accounting firm. And only seven out of every
          1,000 tax returns are audited by the agency, and even then the IRS is not always scrutinizing a group ’s political activity. And that ’s why those parody travel promotions are so important. So, the fact that SAN did n’t expressly mention
          candidates in its ads does not mean that they were not political. Alphabet Inc. ’s Google for millions in ad dollars from Secure America Large portions of the group ’s spending are a black hole. More than $ 7.4 million in the SAN ’s

          The American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) commends and supports Stephen Moore ’s selection to the Federal Reserve ’s board of governors. As a champion for market-driven solutions and an expert in state-based economic policy he is
          sure to represent a fresh, outsider opinion at the Federal Reserve. Stephen Moore also served President Ronald Reagan as an economic adviser, serves on the ALEC board of scholars, and served on the editorial board at the Wall Street
          Journal, among many other accolades. In 25 years of knowing Stephen Moore, he ’s been a stalwart supporter of free-market solutions. He will advance on the Federal Reserve ’s board of governors the same principles he advances as a board
          member for the American Legislative Exchange Council: limited government, free markets and federalism.

          Gay' conversion therapy' advocates heartened by Republican electoral victories
          Long-discredited' conversion therapies' should not be outlawed, advocates say. ‘ conversion therapy ’ is not sound medical practice ” and that such programs “ are harmful and are not appropriate therapeutic practices. They certainly should
          not be prohibited by law, ” Sprigg said in an interview to be broadcast this Friday on the ABC News program “ 20/20 ” in an investigation of gay “ conversion therapy ” programs. The camps practicing “ conversion therapy ” uncovered by the “
          20/20 ” investigation were not operating as licensed mental health facilities and are therefore not covered by laws prohibiting the practice. He said that there is no place for physical abuse in therapy programs.

          In actuality, the concept that dominionist minded conservatives should establish parallel or dual institutions is a new form of segregation.

          Washington Post Staff Writer " More than anyone else, he studied the organizing mechanisms of the left and applied them to create an effective conservative activist movement," said former House majority leader Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ). "
          Paul Weyrich was conservative long, long before it was cool," said American Conservative Union Chairman David A. Keene. More than any person, perhaps excluding President Ronald Reagan, whom he attacked as insufficiently conservative,
          Weyrich stitched the religious, social-issue voters into the secular fabric of the Republican Party. At a 1979 gathering of religious leaders, Weyrich talked about a" moral majority" of American voters. " "

        <p>Paul Weyrich, "father" of the right-wing movement and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation, Moral Majority and various other groups tells his flock that he doesn't want people to vote. He complains that fellow Christians have "Goo-Goo
          Syndrome": Good Government. Classic clip from 1980. This guy still gives weekly strategy sessions to Republicans nowadays. The entire dialog from the clip:
          "Now many of our Christians have what I call the goo-goo syndrome — good government. They want everybody to vote. I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people, they never have been from the beginning of our
          country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down."

          There will be three main stages in the unfolding of this movement. Our movement will be entirely destructive, and entirely constructive. This is a cardinal premise of the new movement. Movement Must Be Based on the Transmission of Ideas,
          This movement is not about the creation of ideas, it is about the transmission and dissemination of ideas. This is not a totalitarian movement. Our movement must be highly provocative. They are the vanguard of a counter- cultural movement.
          This will not be a movement of talkers. They will be asked often what precisely they have done for the good of the movement. Again, members can not be allowed to think of themselves as spectators in this movement. Not all members will be
          intellectuals, although intellectuals will instigate the new movement.

          instance of voter fraud in America extraordinarily small ( see 2007 ). The 29 states that register voter affiliation showed a roughly 2- 1 increase in new Democratic voters over Republicans for 2008, and Obama won almost 70 percent of those
