        <p>
          “ And even though amendments can originate in the states —   a right granted in the second clause of Article V — it has never been done before. And even though Republicans have controlled all three branches of government for nearly two
          years, momentum is building for a first-time convention. Legislation promoted by the Convention of States Project calling for a convention has now been passed by 12 states. A new report by the Associated Press indicates that conservatives
          are pushing for the first-ever Constitutional convention to make amendments without going through Congress. In order for a Constitutional convention to be successful, two-thirds of the states must call for the convention and at least
          three-fourths must approve of the amendment or change.

          There are 2 ways to amend the United States Constitution: One way Amendments proposed by an Article V convention are supposed to be ratified by 38 states. A balanced budget amendment would be crazy enough. An Article V convention would
          allow delegates to write their own agenda into our Constitution. Already 28 states have called for a constitutional convention. Please tell your state lawmakers to reject calls for an Article V convention. " This is a misnomer. Article V
          allows for “ a convention for proposing amendments ”, amendments that subsequently require 75 % of states to ratify. There have in fact been hundreds of Article V Convention resolutions passed in state legislatures. Article V. This is the
          first precedent in place that limits the scope of an Article V Convention. Article V is an example of our founders

          Coburn told the ALEC gathering in an address Friday, “ We are in a battle for the future of our country. We ’re either going to become a socialist, Marxist country, like Western Europe, or we are going to be free. that is peaceful, is this
          convention. ” – But until such a convention takes place, it is obvious that Trump and his allies are sparing no effort to soften public opinion in favor of changing the constitution. The wedge issue is immigration. The rationale is that
          they have been a drain on public resources, whereas the condition for their being allowed into the country included being self-sufficient. With little news about white undocumented immigrants being arrested and deported, it is unlikely that
          the wider crackdown will go after them.

        <p>
          One of the insidious things they are up to is campaigning for a constitutional convention. The other, untested way laid out in Article V is for two-thirds of state legislatures to call for a constitutional convention, also known as an “
          Article V convention, ” to add amendments to the Constitution once they are ratified by three-fourths of the states. Throughout the 230-year history of the U.S. Constitution, an Article V convention has never been called by Congress. THREAT
          OF A RUNAWAY CONVENTION: LACK OF CONVENTION RULES: There are no rules governing constitutional conventions. Luckily, four States have recently rescinded their applications. For the convention to be triggered, all 34 states have to ask for
          the same thing. … there are no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention.
