            Abstract
        </strong>
    </summary>
    <p>
        One of the insidious things they are up to is campaigning for a constitutional convention. The other, untested way laid out in Article V is for two-thirds of state legislatures to call for a constitutional convention, also known as an “ Article V convention, ” to add amendments to the Constitution once they are ratified by three-fourths of the states. Throughout the 230-year history of the U.S. Constitution, an Article V convention has never been called by Congress. THREAT OF A RUNAWAY CONVENTION: LACK OF CONVENTION RULES: There are no rules governing constitutional conventions. Luckily, four States have recently rescinded their applications. For the convention to be triggered, all 34 states have to ask for the same thing. … there are no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention.
