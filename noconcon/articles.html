          In conservative states they lobby states to persuade them to apply for an Amendments Convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment ( BBA ) or to impose fiscal restraints as an answer to controlling federal debt in spite of economists
          warnings about the significant economic threats a BBA would pose. In democratic states, they propose an amendment to end Citizens United. On Jan-24-2017 Congress introduced resolutions SJR8 and HJR31 to remedy Citizens United. Be warned, if
          the threshold of 34 states is met and Congress is forced to call a convention it will cause Constitutional mayhem. SAY NO TO AN ARTICLE V CONVENTION OF STATES

          Calling a new constitutional convention under Article V of the U.S. Constitution is a threat to every American ’s constitutional rights and civil liberties. A convention might not preserve the role of the courts in protecting our
          constitutional rights. [ T]here is no way to effectively limit or muzzle the actions of a constitutional convention. I certainly would not want a constitutional convention. We also strongly urge state legislatures to rescind any application
          for an Article V constitutional convention in order to protect all Americans ’ constitutional rights and privileges from being put at risk and up for grabs.

          The Dangerous Path: Big Money ’s Plan to Shred the   Constitution
          05.1.2016
          Research and Reports There is a threat to our democracy so severe it is shocking it has gone unnoticed this long, or has been dismissed as impossible by the few who know about it and should be sounding the alarm. Given the current
          hyper-partisan environment of U.S. politics, the power of special and corporate interests in the post- Citizens United era, the call for a convention poses a huge threat to the nation. Common Cause ’s 2015 report “ The Dangerous Path:   Big
          Money ’s Plan to Shred the Constitution ” explores the dangerous calls for an Article V convention, who is behind it, and how Americans ’ constitutional rights would be at risk.

          , ” examines a decades-old campaign on behalf of a convention under Article V of the Constitution. Twenty-seven state legislatures have passed resolutions calling for a convention to draft an amendment requiring a balanced federal budget,
          the report notes. The movement for a new constitutional convention is dangerously close to success. Never invoked, Article V calls on Congress to convene a constitutional convention if petitioned to do so by legislatures in two-thirds ( 34
          ) of the states. Since the 1970s, 27 states have submitted petitions calling for a convention to draft a balanced budget amendment; efforts to secure approval are underway in eight other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, the
          report says. But we ’re unwilling to put the entire Constitution at risk in an Article V convention.
