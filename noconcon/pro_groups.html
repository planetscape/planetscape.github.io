 Advocates line up to back constitutional convention As New Yorkers — not as interests groups, not as lobbyists but We want to be able to hold a constitutional convention and urge New Yorkers, our fellow citizens, to vote for a constitutional convention because we need to fix our state government. State lawmakers have the power to put constitutional amendments before the people on the November ballot.

        March 10, 2014
 Americans for a Balanced Budget Amendment, the nation's longest standing, active national organization which has promotion   of a   Balanced Budget Amendment as its sole goal, www.balanceourbudget.com, would like to lend its full support to S 30, which calls for a convention for proposing amendments under Article V of the U.S.
 Constitution, to solely consider a Balanced Budget Amendment for the U.S. Constitution. For the first 200 years of our nation's existence, our country did a good job of balancing revenue and expenditures, apart from times of major wars. We are now running TRILLION DOLLAR deficits with no realistic plan to rein them in.

The Debt Threatens Everything We ’ve Built As interest rates and principal rise, interest will soar to $ 1 trillion / yr. ( 33 % of federal revenue ), eclipsing the cost of Defense and Social Security. We can not survive that way The States Must Target the Debt Via Convention ” Therefore, only a balanced budget amendment ( BBA ) will do. Given Congress ’ 75-year failure to propose a BBA, the states must do so by calling an Article V convention. With 28 states, we are closing in on the 34 necessary to call an Article V convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment! Sign the Petition!

    <p>
        The state flag — modeled after that of the short-lived California Republic — was draped in the corner. If Trump is the question, then California is the answer. For too long, the federal government has treated California like it ’s just another one of the 50 states. California is acting as an enabler. Actually, that ’s not a bad slogan! ” ( The California National Party tweeted, “ Hands off California, Putin. This building will not be a state legislature — it will be the capitol of our country! ” Delaware is a state. Wyoming is a state. California is a nation! ” That ’s kind of a workaround, right? ” But none of California ’s elected officials support it. “ ” ”

        DeMint pushes House of Delegates to support constitutional convention
 Gage Skidmore / Flickr
 Former Sen. Jim DeMint speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2017. — Former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint was in Charleston Monday, pushing members of the House of Delegates to support a movement calling for a convention of states for amending the U.S. Constitution. DeMint serves as a senior adviser for the Convention of States Project, a nationwide organization pushing state legislatures to agree to hold a national convention, in which constitutional amendments would be proposed to limit the powers and spending of the federal government. Twelve states have already passed resolutions supporting a convention of states. DeMint said a bill calling for a convention needs 51 sponsors in the House of Delegates before it could head to a floor vote. “

        The federal government has grown out of control. Many confuse an Article V amending Convention of the States with a “ constitutional convention. ” They are not the same thing. An Article V Convention of States is limited to the subject matter in the applications passed through 34 States. We have become unfamiliar with the process of the states meeting in conventions. Fear is debilitating. The meeting is called. Ratification occurs if three-fourths ( 38 ) agree to the reforms. This process is ingenious. We already know which reforms could pass the high threshold: These are all reforms heavily supported by Americans, but that will never come from Congress. The time is now to act.

 Published in Uncategorized on February 13, 2018 by Convention Of States
 President Trump has, for now, given up on balancing the federal budget in the next ten years – and Congress is to blame, his budget director said Monday, according to the   Wall Street Journal. Combined with a newly passed spending deal and sweeping tax cuts, the budget would see the federal deficit once again rising past $ 1 trillion in the near-term.

        ( Applications grouped by amendment subject, not required by the Constitution for a convention call )
. According to the Constitution, Congress is mandated to call an Article V Convention on the application of 34 states
. Congress created any process for counting state applications. Before implementation, the official count of state applications by Congress stood at zero. The reason: Congress has no rules in place to count the applications and issue the necessary convention call. Article V states," on the application... Congress shall call a convention for proposing amendments. Thus, based on the record of applications already gathered Congress must issue a convention call. Within the 140 applications officially recognized by the House Judiciary Committee are applications from two thirds of the states.

        What happens when Congress itself is the problem in politics? The framers of the Constitution thought of a solution for that very problem. In the 225 years since the Constitution was drafted, we ’ve never had a federal convention. But the idea is familiar within the states. There have been more than 230 state constitutional conventions. It ’s not even clear that the convention was convened in response to any act by Congress. The convention that Congress can convene is instead very different. No one is talking about a second constitutional convention. The inability of our government to act is a catastrophic problem for our kids, not for us. A convention is the chance for such pressure. That is the convention

    </summary>
    <p>
        Article V provides two mechanisms to amend the US Constitution—2/3 of Congress make a specific proposal, or 2/3 of the states call a convention. Article V requires the U.S. Congress to call for a convention when two-thirds ( 34 ) of the state legislatures petition Congress for one. One reason that an Article V convention has never been called is that when close to two-thirds of the states have petitioned Congress, Congress has itself taken action. A wide-open convention is desirable. By Congress In 1987 there were thirty-nine ( more than the 34 required ) convention applications. By 1993 there were 45 state applications for a general convention ( Paulson ). Can Congress impede an Article V convention?

    <p>
        Read more about the history and timeline of corporate personhood encroachment on human constitutional rights here. There are two conceptions of" corporate personhood". However," corporate personhood" also commonly refers to the Supreme Court-created precedent of corporations enjoying constitutional rights that were intended solely for human beings. What is the process to amend the US Constitution? The rights protected by the Constitution of the United States are the rights of natural persons only. So we MUST get it right! Our primary organizing tool is local resolution campaigns. This is a grassroots campaign- we are encouraging folks to form local Affiliates so they can participate in Move to Amend. Is n't the United States a republic? It is not a law, and thus can not be overturned by corporate lawyers.

        We consistently face the issue of conservatives proposing extreme budget cuts that will further rig the system billionaires and big corporations. These required spending caps have forced austerity measures on already cash-strapped government agencies meaning vital social programs have been cut over the years. Worse, recent proposed budget proposals would force further cuts for the purpose of providing tax cuts to the wealthy and profitable corporations. Members of Congress should not support a budget that would shut down critical public services and protections. No Ideological Poison Pill Riders
 Beyond cutting essential monies needed to keep our government functioning and providing the basic services we depend on, conservatives are also threatening to attach hundreds of harmful policy riders to the budget that would repeal essential public protections

FEC has focused America ’s attention on the dangerous influence of corporate power in our democracy and the urgency of taking all necessary measures to undo that influence, including amending the Constitution. Citizens United, which opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate spending to influence elections at all levels of government, has brought home the importance of amending the Constitution to ensure that “ United For The People believes that America works best when our government is of, by, and for the people. Though our supporters   have differences in scope and tactics, we   are organizations united in the understanding that the Court ’s decisions in Citizens United and related cases must be remedied by amending the Constitution in order to restore the democratic promise of America.

 ⅔ of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, or
 ⅔ of the states ( 34 states ) can pass a resolution that calls for a national convention to propose an amendment. Article V also states that either way the amendment is proposed, whether by Congress or a convention, it then goes back to the states for approval ( aka “ ratification ” ). And the opposition may not be who you would think. ” That is factually not true. The runaway convention hypothesis has been debunked by “ “ I think the convention can be limited.

        Term limits supporters always wonder “ how can we get a constitutional amendment to term limit Congress if Congress — which wo n’t limit its own power — The Article V Convention allows the American people to term limit Congress without needing congressional approval. Two-thirds of state legislatures ( 34 ) must pass bills applying for a convention to consider only amendments for congressional term limits. Congress is compelled by law to call the convention, which includes delegates chosen solely by their respective states. The convention reports out an amendment for congressional term limits. The amendment must be ratified by either three-quarters ( 38 ) of state legislatures or state conventions. If you ’re with us in this fight, please sign the petition in support of congressional term limits. This is an exciting time to be a term limits advocate.

    <p>
        Far from a runaway, the 1787 Convention was yet another example of an American convention doing exactly what it was told to do, whether broad or narrow. If the state applications specify radical amendments, then that ’s not running away it ’s attempting to create an entire convention based on bad ideas. Delegates to the convention – who can be recalled and even imprisoned by their states — have some discretion, but it ’s limited to amendments within the subject area chosen by 34 states. Remember: the convention itself has zero power to amend our Constitution. is the notion that Congress will take over the convention to send its favorite radical amendments to the states. This is invalid for one obvious reason: Congress does n’t need a convention to do that.

        Could the third time be the charm for advocates of
 California secession
 from the U.S.? Yes California ” is giving it another try anyway. ” the campaign ’s website says. ”
 Signature-gathering attempts were dropped amid questions about founder Louis Marinelli ’s ties to Russia. Now Yes California is trying again. If the measure passes, and yes, that ’s a big if, an official referendum would be held in 2021. Yes California says its main policy concerns include education reform, universal health care, fighting climate change, localizing immigration enforcement and keeping the state ’s tax revenue in the state. Here ’s what else you should know about it. Meanwhile, efforts to form a new state called “ new California ” and to split California into three separate states are also underway.

    <p>
        There are only two ways to propose a U.S. Constitutional Amendment, as stated in Article V of the U.S. Constitution:
 ⅔ of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, or
 ⅔ of the states ( 34 states ) can pass a resolution that calls for a national convention to propose an amendment. Article V also states that either way the amendment is proposed, whether by Congress or a convention, it then goes back to the states for approval ( aka “ ratification ” ). And the opposition may not be who you would think. ” That is factually not true. The runaway convention hypothesis has been debunked by “ “ I think the convention can be limited. This system must be fixed. Corruption must be uprooted.
