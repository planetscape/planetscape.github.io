        </summary>
        <p>
          The Constitution does not say if more than a simple majority vote of delegates to the convention is needed to propose an amendment. Readers would think that if any serious effort were occurring to call a U.S. constitutional convention, it
          would be front-line news. With a number of Republican-controlled legislatures yet to vote on such a resolution, the potential is there to have such a convention called as early as 2019. Once called, a convention could go anywhere. There
          would be nothing to prevent a new convention from amending the standards for approval. I would be concerned if either party were in a position to unilaterally propose a convention.

        <p>
          This is also what the demonizing of the visa lottery program is all about. In fiscal 2017, which ended Sept. 30, the largest number of visas went to citizens of African countries ” while applicants from European countries and from Asia
          received fewer visas than before. That is why conservatives cheer the moves by young liberals to densely populated cities. The move weakens conservative votes in the places they move to and strengthens it in places they move from. In the
          Electoral College, each individual Wyoming vote weighs 3.6 times more than an individual Californian ’s vote. But probably the biggest, gutsiest move is the call for a constitutional convention. This is War.

          Lawmakers push for ‘ constitutional convention ’ to restrict federal government – and it ’s There is growing confidence a convention could take place, introducing new constitutional amendments: ‘ We ’re in a battle for the future of our
          country, ” Coburn told the assembly of mostly conservative state lawmakers meeting in New Orleans. ”
          Convention of States, with Alec ’s support, is one of three prominent conservative groups pushing for a new constitutional convention. For the convention to be triggered, all 34 states have to ask for the same thing. “

          of the states may demand that Congress form a constitutional convention to propose amendments. Amendments proposed by an Article V convention are supposed to be ratified by 38 states. But convention delegates could hijack the process and
          change the ratification process itself, tossing out the 38 state requirement. A balanced budget amendment would be crazy enough. But nothing would be safe. Marriage equality. Equal protection of the laws. Advertisement: Already 28 states
          have called for a constitutional convention. But, believe me, this is important. Please tell your state lawmakers to reject calls for an Article V convention. " " • ------------------------------------------

          Our campaign finance laws ca n't be solved by a constitutional convention
          By Fred Wertheimer, opinion contributor — 07/04/18 In the last several years, a number of states have passed resolutions calling for a constitutional convention to propose amendments to our nation ’s founding document. The fight over
          calling a constitutional convention, however, is not a fight about any single amendment or fundamental issue. We believe that calling a new constitutional convention under Article V of the U.S. Constitution is a threat to every American ’s
          constitutional rights and civil liberties and a descent into entirely new, scary territory for our nation. There are no rules for the functioning of a constitutional convention or setting its agenda. The convention ’s delegates have all the
          power to select a convention A constitutional convention would wreak havoc in the country.

          Democrats have traditionally done very well in Washington state. There ’s clearly a lot ot Dem support in WA state and as we approach Midterms 2018, it is important that Dems point out GOP ’s efforts to change the U.S. Constitution
          According to the Washington state Legislature ’s website, the state ’s Constitutional Convention proposal HJM4006, was   introduced on January 19 2017 and has 16 sponsors. However there is a strange twist in Washington state ’s NoConCon
          battle. Here ’s a HANDY LIST of the 15 WA GOP state politicians pushing Koch Brothers / ALEC ’s radical plan to change the U.S. Constitution and thereby eliminate Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security

          This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. × Missouri Legislature calls for new constitutional   convention
          JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. ( AP ) – Missouri has formally called for a national convention to add congressional term limits to the U.S. Constitution. The resolution, approved by the House Tuesday and the Senate Thursday in a 24- 6 vote, makes
          Missouri one of the first states to call for an Article V Convention of the States. Proponents say term limits in the U.S. House and Senate would be a good check on power. Opponents say term limits cripple lawmakers ’ ability to gain
          valuable experience. If no convention is called within five years, Missouri ’s resolution would expire. _ _ The proposal is SCR 40

          Missouri House endorses term limits for Congress By Jason Taylor
          The Missouri House has passed a resolution which would call for term limits on U.S. Congressional members. Two-thirds of the states would have to pass a resolution for the gathering to take place. The resolution specifically calls for a
          convention to set term limits on Congress. The proposal in the state legislature was first approved in the Senate. The lower chamber attached a five-year limit to the proposal. The proposal does not specify the number of terms under which
          Congressional members would be limited. Convention of States ( COS ) has three priorities. Missouri became the 12th COS member last year when a resolution from Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, successfully passed both chambers.

          Whether States should ask Congress to call a convention under Article V of our federal Constitution is one of the most important issues of our time. “ * Heck no! ” There was a convention to propose amendments to our first Constitution! But
          Natelson does n’t mention the federal “ amendments ” convention of 1787. That is the “ meeting ” which is relevant to the convention Congress has the power to call under Article V of our Constitution. The “ calling ” of a convention by
          Congress is governed- not by Natelson ’s “ meetings ”- but by provisions in our Constitution. 2 9.

          Dangerous Koch Brothers Are Out To Change The Koch Brothers not only heavily fund ALEC, they sit on its Board. So what exactly does ALEC do? This is so repugnant because the Koch Brothers literally use ALEC to subvert the will of the people
          ( Democracy ). But subverting Democracy is by no means the end of ALEC / Koch Brothers ’ radical agenda. The Koch Brothers through ALEC are currently mobilizing Republican-controlled states(with GOP majorities in state legislature ) to call
          for a Convention of States, a rarely used Constitutional mechanism that can be used to change the U.S. Constitution. As for now folks just remember that the Koch Brothers with their outfit ALEC are up to no good and we need to watch them.

          This legislation proposes that Colorado ask Congress to call a convention to propose new amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Recall that Article V of the Constitution identifies two methods of enacting constitutional amendments.
          Alternatively, if at least two-thirds ( 34 ) of the states ask Congress to form a constitutional convention to propose and consider amendments, then Congress must call such a convention. Indeed, for these reasons, no constitutional
          convention has been called since the first in 1787. Although most constitutional amendments have addressed only a single issue, nothing in Article V requires this. There is thus no way to predict what constitutional amendments the delegates
          to a convention might adopt. ’s pernicious influence that Colorado should not call for an Article V constitutional convention.

          The so-called “ Faithful Delegate ” bill, Legislative Bill 1058, presumes that the Legislature will be able to control Nebraska delegates to a constitutional convention. Indeed, regardless of one ’s political views, there are good reasons
          to think a constitutional convention could do the nation far more harm than good. Second, two-thirds of the states can request that Congress call a constitutional convention for proposing amendments. State senators favoring a particular
          constitutional amendment may find that a convention proposes something entirely different. LB 1058 anticipates these objections and purports to constrain Nebraska ’s convention delegates. The bill, for instance, stipulates that certain
          Nebraska officials will automatically serve as delegates to an Article V convention. Even if they did not, delegates may not cast any votes until they voted on the convention ’s final product.

          Second, if two-thirds of the states ask Congress to call a constitutional convention, Congress must do so. These groups are seeking to persuade state legislatures to take the country into the uncharted territory of an Article V convention.
          Nothing in Article V, or anywhere else in the Constitution, authorizes Congress, state legislatures, or anyone else to limit the agenda of an Article V convention. Once selected, delegates to an Article V convention become federal officials
          with authority derived from Article V, not from the states. State courts have no authority to intervene in a federal constitutional convention. Calling an Article V convention is reckless, especially at this divisive moment in our nation ’s
          political history. State legislatures should not delude themselves that the dangers of an Article V convention can somehow be contained.

          While Article V requires Congress to call a convention upon the applications of two-thirds of the states, the constitutional text makes no provision for the states to limit the agenda for such a convention. Thus, were the convention

          Yet a constitutional convention is a dangerous and uncharted mechanism to address these problems. Minnesotans should reject resolutions currently before the state Legislature calling for a constitutional convention. This process has never
          been used. If a constitutional convention were called by the states under Article V, it is not clear how much could be done to prevent the process from being captured by and dominated by special interests. Because no constitutional
          convention has ever been called under Article V, exactly what rules govern are in question. At present, there are no rules regarding who can participate, give money, lobby or have a voice in a constitutional convention. Finally, there are
          no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention.

          In short, under the US Constitution, if ⅔ of state legislatures call for a convention to amend it, the convening must take place. Lately, calls and momentum for a Convention seem to be gaining steam. The other path to amending our
          constitution has not yet been tested: a constitutional convention. — federal vs. state. It seems to be the House Judiciary committee within Congress, who is recognizing and validating calls from the states for a convention. some would say
          we ’re very close to the threshold with 28 states calling for a convention; others would say we ’re closer to 13 or 17. Sure. — there have been calls for constitutional conventions almost since the beginning, and so where you begin to count
          them is important.

          South Carolina governor Henry McMaster does not support calling a convention of states to address changes to the U.S. Constitution. Not surprisingly, Templeton ’s campaign wasted little time taking a dig at McMaster … Catherine prefers to
          stand with the people of South Carolina, Jim DeMint, and conservatives instead of Henry McMaster and Democrats. The other method is a two-thirds vote of the U.S. House and Senate. Are there really thirty-eight states out there likely to
          support repealing the Second Amendment? Or abolishing the Electoral College? We think not … The rest – 36.1 percent – were undecided. ” That ’s true … “ Developing … * CLICK HERE. Want to support what we ’re doing? SUBSCRIBE HERE. Banner:

          By a vote of 18- 16 on Wednesday, the South Dakota Senate handed a stinging defeat to the national effort to call for a constitutional convention under Article V of the Constitution. Yet, the bill was defeated. Kitty has been the leading
          conservative in South Dakota for 40 years, ” Schlafly said after hearing of the effort ’s defeat. Today she did it again. Schlafly added that since there was no motion for reconsideration, “ the Convention of States is finished for the year
          in South Dakota. “ Of course, she had lots of help from volunteers in South Dakota. … Another factor in the proposal ’s defeat in South Dakota is a growing awareness that the idea of a Con-Con is being supported by many on the Left. ” ”

          Iowa Republicans ’ Copy-And-Paste ALEC Constitutional Convention Bill A Senate subcommittee recently moved forward Senate Joint Resolution 8 to full committee, which would add Iowa to a national movement calling for a convention of all 50
          states to amend the U.S. Constitution. It ’s part of an effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) Here ’s the text of Iowa ’s Senate Joint Resolution 8: And here ’s suggested text from the ALEC website:
          Literally the same exact wording. Oddly enough, the constitutional convention bill may not work out exactly as Republicans hope it to, which is why even some fellow conservatives are opposed to the effort. There has not been a
          constitutional convention in America since 1787 – The problem is that a constitutional convention could very easily become a free-for-all.

          return it to the states. Article V of the U.S. Constitution grants “ two thirds of the several States ” the power to “ call a Convention for proposing Amendments ” if they deem necessary. Once they adopt and ratify the amendments, they
          become part of the U.S. Constitution. Not all Republicans are on board. The Constitution is not outdated. It is simply ignored. “ There is no recourse after a 100 years of ever-expanding federal power. ” lies in an amendment of the Constn.
          according to a process applicable by the States.

          The convention of states mechanism should only be used under similar circumstances. However, this has not stopped states from incurring debt. The convention process would be dominated by state lawmakers. Restraining federal spending starts
          in the states. If state lawmakers want to restrain federal spending, they need to start by addressing their own role in that process. Arguing for a convention of states is a relatively painless way for the General Assembly to appear in
          opposition to irresponsible federal policies. The only time a convention of states should be called is when every other tool for controlling our government has failed. The only way to change federal policy is to hold both federal and state
          lawmakers accountable.

        <p>
          Speaking on a panel about the Constitution during the 2018 Bradley Symposium at the Heritage Foundation, Kesler promoted a conservative originalist approach to the 18th Century Constitution: He described one Constitution, the original 1787
          document as amended, as steeped in natural rights and limited government. This one, he said, is also the “ conservatives ’ Constitution. ” The other one is the “ living Constitution, ” or what he called “ the liberals ’ Constitution. ”
          Kesler said that a “ cold civil war ” broke out when conservatives fought back:
          The conservatives who began an epic campaign against the inevitable emergency of the living Constitution had in common the desire, the duty to oppose the gradual disappearance of limited government from American political life.

          The call for a constitutional convention of the states to corral federal government overreach and budget mismanagement is now making its way through the Iowa Senate. Senate Joint Resolution 8 states that being that The resolution goes on to
          further state that the resolution serves as an application to Congress asking for a constitutional convention, as outlined in Article V of the U.S. Constitution, in order to create constitutional amendments that impose such restrictions on
          the federal government. According to Article V of the Constitution, there are no specifics about which petitions Congress can accept calling for a constitutional convention, just that 34 total states need to submit one. Olson, argues that
          the Constitution has flaws and supports amendments to corral the federal government, but also argues that calling a convention is “ dangerous and uncharted. ”

          Current Article V Convention Campaigns LACK OF CONVENTION RULES: There are no rules governing constitutional conventions. Simply put, an Article V constitutional convention is a dangerous and uncontrollable process that would put Americans
          ’ constitutional rights up for grabs. I certainly would not want a constitutional convention. … there are no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention. Indeed, for these reasons, no constitutional convention has been
          called since the first in 1787. A convention would be impossible to control. A constitutional convention might not sound like such a bad idea if it stopped there. America has n’t held a constitutional convention since 1787. What would
          happen at a convention of states?.
