    </summary>
    <p>
        The Constitution does not say if more than a simple majority vote of delegates to the convention is needed to propose an amendment. Readers would think that if any serious effort were occurring to call a U.S. constitutional convention, it would be front-line news. With a number of Republican-controlled legislatures yet to vote on such a resolution, the potential is there to have such a convention called as early as 2019. Once called, a convention could go anywhere. There would be nothing to prevent a new convention from amending the standards for approval. I would be concerned if either party were in a position to unilaterally propose a convention.

        The bills assert that such an “ interstate convention ” is authorized by Article I, § 10, clause 3; the 10th Amendment; and Article V of our Constitution. What Article V says about amending our Constitution
 Article V says:
 “ We ’ve never had a convention under Article V – First of all, our federal Constitution does n’t address “ interstate conventions ”! Secondly, a “ Compact with another State ” within the meaning of Article I, § 10, clause 3, is separate, distinct, and totally unrelated to the Article V convention called by Congress for the purpose of addressing our federal Constitution.

One of them has never been used. Recommended Slideshows ' Style muse': Those amendments are then sent to the states, and three-fourths must approve before the change is made. Again, it is not easy.

Up to 28 states have already called for one It ’s “ A state ballot initiative outlining talking points for a convention ”
 To be clear, the state of California has already called for a constitutional convention, back in 2014. But beyond those two states, the convention movement has largely been led by conservative interests. We ’ll be the responsible adults. That is a sensational experience.

        Must Kill Washington State ’s ConCon Proposal Before A Vote
 Democrats have traditionally done very well in Washington state. There ’s clearly a lot ot Dem support in WA state and as we approach Midterms 2018, it is important that Dems point out GOP ’s efforts to change the U.S. Constitution According to the Washington state Legislature ’s website, the state ’s Constitutional Convention proposal HJM4006, was   introduced on January 19 2017 and has 16 sponsors. However there is a strange twist in Washington state ’s NoConCon battle. Here ’s a HANDY LIST of the 15 WA GOP state politicians pushing Koch Brothers / ALEC ’s radical plan to change the U.S. Constitution and thereby eliminate Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security

According to the PA Legislature website, the proposal is still lying in the PA Legislature with no vote taken on it yet. That leaves us with only 7 PA GOP ConCons to go after(proposal sponsors ). They are up for reelection so its important that we kick them and their ConCon proposal out of the PA Legislature in Midterms 2018 Here ’s a HANDY LIST of the 7 PA GOP State politicians pushing Koch Brothers / ALEC ’s radical plan to change the U.S. Constitution and thereby eliminate Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security

        / Missouri House endorses term limits for Congress
 Missouri House endorses term limits for Congress By Jason Taylor
 The Missouri House has passed a resolution which would call for term limits on U.S. Congressional members. Two-thirds of the states would have to pass a resolution for the gathering to take place. The resolution specifically calls for a convention to set term limits on Congress. The proposal in the state legislature was first approved in the Senate. The lower chamber attached a five-year limit to the proposal. The proposal does not specify the number of terms under which Congressional members would be limited. Convention of States ( COS ) has three priorities. Missouri became the 12th COS member last year when a resolution from Sen. Mike Kehoe, R-Jefferson City, successfully passed both chambers.

        NPR's Noel King talks with commentator Cokie Roberts, who answers listener questions about a possible constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget amendment. Here to answer your questions about how that would work is Cokie Roberts, who spoke with Noel King. Our first question gets to the mechanics of a constitutional convention, and it comes from Twitter, from Leon Ledlow ( ph ). Well, that gets, actually, to our second question. That's the big question, and it's the reason so many people are fearful of a convention. Cokie, we also got a question about the more traditional amendment process through Congress. Well, that's a good question. That's commentator Cokie Roberts. Copyright © 2018 NPR. The authoritative record of NPR ’s programming is the audio record.

    <p>
        This legislation proposes that Colorado ask Congress to call a convention to propose new amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Recall that Article V of the Constitution identifies two methods of enacting constitutional amendments. Alternatively, if at least two-thirds ( 34 ) of the states ask Congress to form a constitutional convention to propose and consider amendments, then Congress must call such a convention. Indeed, for these reasons, no constitutional convention has been called since the first in 1787. Although most constitutional amendments have addressed only a single issue, nothing in Article V requires this. There is thus no way to predict what constitutional amendments the delegates to a convention might adopt. ’s pernicious influence that Colorado should not call for an Article V constitutional convention.

Iowa Senate is considering a flawed proposal to amend the constitution We have not had a constitutional convention since 1787 when the U.S. Constitution was written in Philadelphia. | ” This method has not been used since the constitution was first written. One of the most important powers given the federal government is the power to tax and spend for the general welfare.

    <p>
        The so-called “ Faithful Delegate ” bill, Legislative Bill 1058, presumes that the Legislature will be able to control Nebraska delegates to a constitutional convention. Indeed, regardless of one ’s political views, there are good reasons to think a constitutional convention could do the nation far more harm than good. Second, two-thirds of the states can request that Congress call a constitutional convention for proposing amendments. State senators favoring a particular constitutional amendment may find that a convention proposes something entirely different. LB 1058 anticipates these objections and purports to constrain Nebraska ’s convention delegates. The bill, for instance, stipulates that certain Nebraska officials will automatically serve as delegates to an Article V convention. Even if they did not, delegates may not cast any votes until they voted on the convention ’s final product.

        Second, if two-thirds of the states ask Congress to call a constitutional convention, Congress must do so. These groups are seeking to persuade state legislatures to take the country into the uncharted territory of an Article V convention. Nothing in Article V, or anywhere else in the Constitution, authorizes Congress, state legislatures, or anyone else to limit the agenda of an Article V convention. Once selected, delegates to an Article V convention become federal officials with authority derived from Article V, not from the states. State courts have no authority to intervene in a federal constitutional convention. Calling an Article V convention is reckless, especially at this divisive moment in our nation ’s political history. State legislatures should not delude themselves that the dangers of an Article V convention can somehow be contained.

        Yet a constitutional convention is a dangerous and uncharted mechanism to address these problems. Minnesotans should reject resolutions currently before the state Legislature calling for a constitutional convention. This process has never been used. If a constitutional convention were called by the states under Article V, it is not clear how much could be done to prevent the process from being captured by and dominated by special interests. Because no constitutional convention has ever been called under Article V, exactly what rules govern are in question. At present, there are no rules regarding who can participate, give money, lobby or have a voice in a constitutional convention. Finally, there are no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention.

freedom of assembly, or any other policy issues or constitutional protection
could be subject to change.&rdquo;</blockquote>

 South Carolina governor Henry McMaster does not support calling a convention of states to address changes to the U.S. Constitution. Not surprisingly, Templeton ’s campaign wasted little time taking a dig at McMaster … Catherine prefers to stand with the people of South Carolina, Jim DeMint, and conservatives instead of Henry McMaster and Democrats. The other method is a two-thirds vote of the U.S. House and Senate. Are there really thirty-eight states out there likely to support repealing the Second Amendment? Or abolishing the Electoral College? We think not … The rest – 36.1 percent – were undecided. ” That ’s true … “ Developing … * CLICK HERE. Want to support what we ’re doing? SUBSCRIBE HERE. Banner:

 By a vote of 18- 16 on Wednesday, the South Dakota Senate handed a stinging defeat to the national effort to call for a constitutional convention under Article V of the Constitution. Yet, the bill was defeated. Kitty has been the leading conservative in South Dakota for 40 years, ” Schlafly said after hearing of the effort ’s defeat. Today she did it again. Schlafly added that since there was no motion for reconsideration, “ the Convention of States is finished for the year in South Dakota. “ Of course, she had lots of help from volunteers in South Dakota. … Another factor in the proposal ’s defeat in South Dakota is a growing awareness that the idea of a Con-Con is being supported by many on the Left. ” ”

        Iowa Republicans ’ Copy-And-Paste ALEC Constitutional Convention Bill A Senate subcommittee recently moved forward Senate Joint Resolution 8 to full committee, which would add Iowa to a national movement calling for a convention of all 50 states to amend the U.S. Constitution. It ’s part of an effort by the American Legislative Exchange Council ( ALEC ) Here ’s the text of Iowa ’s Senate Joint Resolution 8: And here ’s suggested text from the ALEC website:
 Literally the same exact wording. Oddly enough, the constitutional convention bill may not work out exactly as Republicans hope it to, which is why even some fellow conservatives are opposed to the effort. There has not been a constitutional convention in America since 1787 – The problem is that a constitutional convention could very easily become a free-for-all.

 Courtesy of Charles and David Koch That ’s what we ’re about, ” Charles Koch said. These programs break against the images of the Koch brothers as political villains. And that ’s part of the point: the Koch brothers network has long insisted that it dallies in politics as a means to push policy. Consider that stage that brought together Cruz, Scarface and Carlos on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This network does, ” said Evan Feinberg, who leads the venture-philanthropy arm of the Koch network dedicated to such out-of-the-box funding. ” network adviser Lauren McCann asked Charles Koch rhetorically during one session, giving voice to a worry many privately harbor. Koch knew the pushback.

        Iowa Close to Becoming the 13th State to Call for Article V Convention of States 3 Comments ( Photo: AP ) Iowa could become the 13th state to call for a convention of states to restrict the power and authority of the federal government and return it to the states. Article V of the U.S. Constitution grants “ two thirds of the several States ” the power to “ call a Convention for proposing Amendments ” if they deem necessary. Once they adopt and ratify the amendments, they become part of the U.S. Constitution. Not all Republicans are on board. The Constitution is not outdated. It is simply ignored. “ There is no recourse after a 100 years of ever-expanding federal power. ” lies in an amendment of the Constn. according to a process applicable by the States.

        Why Do the Koch Brothers Want a Convention of States? In brief, Schumacher is proposing that the Nebraska constitution be amended to grant “ sovereignty ” to thinly settled areas in the western part of the state. This is not a unique idea. This sounds a bit like what Schumacher is up to when he talks about his deregulated sovereign area and how it ’s for people who “ do n’t But the use of disunion as a political tool is exemplified best by the campaign to call a constitutional convention of the states under Article V of the present Constitution. have commitments from 28 state legislatures. They need 34 to trigger the Constitution ’s provision for a “ convention of the states. Disunion would be triumphant.

        The convention of states mechanism should only be used under similar circumstances. However, this has not stopped states from incurring debt. The convention process would be dominated by state lawmakers. Restraining federal spending starts in the states. If state lawmakers want to restrain federal spending, they need to start by addressing their own role in that process. Arguing for a convention of states is a relatively painless way for the General Assembly to appear in opposition to irresponsible federal policies. The only time a convention of states should be called is when every other tool for controlling our government has failed. The only way to change federal policy is to hold both federal and state lawmakers accountable.

        Speaking on a panel about the Constitution during the 2018 Bradley Symposium at the Heritage Foundation, Kesler promoted a conservative originalist approach to the 18th Century Constitution: He described one Constitution, the original 1787 document as amended, as steeped in natural rights and limited government. This one, he said, is also the “ conservatives ’ Constitution. ” The other one is the “ living Constitution, ” or what he called “ the liberals ’ Constitution. ” Kesler said that a “ cold civil war ” broke out when conservatives fought back:
 The conservatives who began an epic campaign against the inevitable emergency of the living Constitution had in common the desire, the duty to oppose the gradual disappearance of limited government from American political life.

Senate Joint Resolution 8 states that being that The resolution goes on to further state that the resolution serves as an application to Congress asking for a constitutional convention, as outlined in Article V of the U.S. Constitution, in order to create constitutional amendments that impose such restrictions on the federal government. According to Article V of the Constitution, there are no specifics about which petitions Congress can accept calling for a constitutional convention, just that 34 total states need to submit one. Olson, argues that the Constitution has flaws and supports amendments to corral the federal government, but also argues that calling a convention is “ dangerous and uncharted. ”

        Current Article V Convention Campaigns LACK OF CONVENTION RULES: There are no rules governing constitutional conventions. Simply put, an Article V constitutional convention is a dangerous and uncontrollable process that would put Americans ’ constitutional rights up for grabs. I certainly would not want a constitutional convention. … there are no rules limiting what can be debated at a constitutional convention. Indeed, for these reasons, no constitutional convention has been called since the first in 1787. A convention would be impossible to control. A constitutional convention might not sound like such a bad idea if it stopped there. America has n’t held a constitutional convention since 1787. What would happen at a convention of states?.
