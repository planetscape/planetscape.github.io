          concerning norms. Unaddressed problems in the influence industry There has long been a revolving door between military and intelligence and private influence industries. PR companies, and wider cultural industries have frequently been
          involved in wartime propaganda which raises problems itself. All SCL Group companies could draw on the methodologies developed. These companies are part of a wider industry we must n’t lose sight of. relationships between, the companies.
          all concerns raised in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. There could also be penalties for defense contractors in each country found obscuring overlaps and company relationships. What is Emerdata?
