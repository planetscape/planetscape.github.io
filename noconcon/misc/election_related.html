          The cut of their jib —
          DHS, FBI say election systems in all 50 states were targeted in 2016 While the bulletin contains no new technical information, it is the first official report to confirm that the Russian reconnaissance and hacking efforts in advance of the
          election went well beyond the 21 states confirmed in previous reports. While not providing specific details, the bulletin continued," The FBI and DHS assess that Russian government cyber actors probably conducted research and reconnaissance
          against all US states ’ election networks leading up to the 2016 Presidential elections. We assume the Russian government researched and in some cases targeted election infrastructure in all 50 states in an attempt to sow discord and
          influence the 2016 election.

          Recent reports reaffirm that America should “ harden our defenses ” against ongoing external attacks on our democracy
          Facebook Two very important – … We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our electoral system from subversion. In a related Call to Action paper issued by the George W. Bush Institute on the same day, Peter Wehner and I noted
          that this matters in a global strategic sense because the quality of our democracy – and whether it in fact works for all Americans – directly impacts America ’s ability to play its leadership role internationally. “ ” ” The vitality of
          American democracy is thus intertwined with our country ’s ability to be strong and persuasive on the global stage.
