        </summary>
        <p>
          Both the Koch brothers and Cato are known for supporting and spreading climate science   denial. No   Information The lunch – requested by UK special advisor McLoughlin –   was organised by Cato ’s Ryan Bourne, a Chair in public
          understanding of economics at the think tank. Nothing more, however, is known about the lunch meeting between Cato and Theresa May ’s special advisers. we are going to put on a small, informal lunch up near my office at Cato for 8 people.
          Will be very   informal. The lunch meeting was originally disclosed on the government ’s transparency logs at the end of June. The Prime Minister ’s Office also confirmed that the meeting was an “ informal   lunch ”. However, it ’s unclear
          what makes a meeting
