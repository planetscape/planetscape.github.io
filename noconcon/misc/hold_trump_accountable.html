        DeVos' Proposed Education Cuts Go Way Deeper Than The Special Olympics
 Tuesday, April 2, 2019 At the Smart Dissent Education page linked here, we have written over and over and over about the heinous efforts of the worthless Betsy DeVos to destroy our education system. Instead of drastically needed help for our schools and students, DeVos repeatedly inflict more harm in new ways. Now her Education Department is proposes savage budget cuts to vital programs. Let's shine a spotlight on what she's trying to do in hopes it exposes her to more sustained criticism.

        By Daniel Dale, Washington Bureau Chief The Star is keeping track of every false claim U.S. President Donald Trump has made since his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. Why? Historians say there has never been such a constant liar in the Oval Office. We think dishonesty should be challenged. We think inaccurate information should be corrected. And we think the sheer frequency of Trump ’s inaccuracy is a central story of his presidency. If Trump is a serial liar, why call this a list of “ false claims, ” not lies? You can read our detailed explanation here. In some cases, he may have been confused or ignorant. What we know, objectively, is that he was not telling the truth.

    <p>
        By Daniel Dale, Washington Bureau Chief The Star is keeping track of every false claim U.S. President Donald Trump has made since his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. Why? Historians say there has never been such a constant liar in the Oval Office. We think dishonesty should be challenged. We think inaccurate information should be corrected. And we think the sheer frequency of Trump ’s inaccuracy is a central story of his presidency. If Trump is a serial liar, why call this a list of “ false claims, ” not lies? You can read our detailed explanation here. In some cases, he may have been confused or ignorant. What we know, objectively, is that he was not telling the truth.

Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) May 31, 2018 But here ’s what Trump himself said to NBC ’s ” That ’s taken off. Almost one third of Trump ’s claims — 931 — relate to economic issues, trade deals or jobs. Not surprisingly, immigration is another source of Trump ’s misleading claims, now totaling 379. Misleading claims about taxes — now at 299 — are also a common feature of Trump ’s speeches. ”

        Comey gets real in CNN Town Hall 02:28
 Fired FBI Director James Comey, in a town hall late last month with CNN's Anderson Cooper, described the challenge of rebutting all of Trump's false claims nicely. ( Trump's ) style of conversation was a series of assertions about great things he had done. I'm great , I'm great, I'm great.' "
 Comey's point is that if you were going to try to correct every exaggeration, distortion or falsehood that came out of Trump's mouth, you would have to interrupt him on a near-constant basis. In fact, the more the media fact-checks Trump, the more his supporters believe him.

        The true state of Donald Trump's union? Unlimited corruption
 Donald Trump's first year as president ushered in an era of overwhelming, uncontrolled corruption
-- “ " The Art of the Lie" tries to organize this overwhelming tide of information by classifying   Trump malfeasance. " It is difficult to track down where foreign businesses and foreign governments may be currying favor in business deals that directly go into Trump ’s pockets," she said. There is no way to know if Trump is making policy decisions to benefit foreign interests in return for receiving financial benefits from the foreign interests. " Why? Trump's corruption has spread beyond the White House and has completely consumed the Republican caucus in both houses of Congress. " ------------------------------------------

Trump ’s use of Josef Stalin ’s phrase “ enemy of the people ” to describe journalists But not all First Amendment defenders take Trump ’s media wars so lightly. Abrams said he ’s “ hopeful ” that Gorsuch will rigorously defend the First Amendment, but that “ Indeed, Trump ’s assault on free speech is far more direct, aggressive, and broadly destructive than anything yet seen in the United States. With a few exceptions, such as Flake and McCain, conservatives take Trump ’s assaults on free speech merrily in stride.

There ’s a pattern about Trump ’s exaggerations. — This dynamic is represented in the near-tie for Trump ’s most repeated claims. Both of these claims date from the start of Trump ’s presidency and to a large extent have faded as talking points. Obviously, now that he ’s been president for a year, there should be less of a need for Trump to point to deals that predated his presidency.

The official White House visitor logs keep a record of who sees the president and his staff — POLITICO ’s Unauthorized White House Visitor Logs stand in for the official record, which the administration has decided not to release publicly. To build a better, completely public visitor log, we compiled not just visits to the White House, but interactions that include in-person meetings with the president at Mar-a-Lago and other venues, appearances at events and documented phone calls with foreign leaders and other politicians. Here ’s what we know so far

        Tracking President Trump's visits to Trump properties The president regularly visits his personal properties and golf courses in Virginia, Florida, and New Jersey. On a July 2018 trip to the U.K., the president visited his Trump Turnberry golf property in Scotland. How many times has Trump gone golfing as president? Trump visited his golf clubs more than 150 times in his first official year in office, and at least 77 times in his second year in office. With the exception of extended stays at his golf resort in Bedminster, Trump usually frequents his properties on weekends. How much does Trump's travel cost? Presidents other than Trump incurred similar questions about travel costs. This tracker automatically counts Trump's days in office. When Trump arrives at one of his properties, the tracker updates accordingly.

And the efforts of Ivanka ’s business and the Kushner family business to leverage their White House status parallel the ethical violations of the president. Donald Trump campaigned by promising to run government like a business. Unfortunately, that business is Trump University.

        What's your real agenda here? Are n't you trying to get Trump impeached? We really mean it when we say that our sole purpose is to better educate the public about Donald Trump. There is a lot of internal debate within RAGEPATH about what the" best outcome" of a Trump Administration would be. Impeachment might compound the destabilizing effect on American democracy that Trump has already had. We know too much about Trump to like him. How do I get out of this alternate reality and return to the real world where" President Trump" was just a harmless joke? Countless realities where Hillary Clinton is serving as President ( and presumably warding off Republican impeachment efforts ) will be swamped and destabilized by waves of transdimensional refugees fleeing the Trump regime.

        We have been tracking President Trump ’s false or misleading claims for more than seven months. Somewhere around Aug. 4 or Aug. 5, he broke 1,000 claims, and the tally now stands at 1,057. That ’s an impressive number by any standard. At the president ’s current pace, he averages nearly five   claims a day. Many are repeats of claims that have been previously debunked. ”
 More than 30 of the president ’s misleading statements have been repeated three or more times. ” Both claims were deemed Four-Pinocchios false in 2016. Yet Trump brought them up 11 times. Some of Trump ’s favorite claims are simply odd. But with five months to go, all bets are off. Keep tabs on Trump ’s promises with our Trump Promise Tracker

        We also looked at a senator ’s overall rhetoric toward Trump since he was inaugurated, and how they reacted to Trump ’s comments on the Charlottesville protests. Trump ’s firing of FBI Director James B. Comey Senators were measured on their public statements about Trump ’s decision to fire FBI Director James B. Comey on May 9. Repeal plan for the Affordable Care Act Senators were measured on their public statements and voting record on the Senate ’s health-care bill. In July, the GOP ’s seven-year quest to repeal and replace Obamacare, one of Trump ’s hallmark campaign promises, was halted when three GOP senators voted against the bill. Charlottesville protests Senators were measured on their public statements following Trump ’s remarks on the violence at a white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12.

        U.S. President Donald Trump has never gone a full week without a false claim, but some weeks are worse than others. From last Thursday, the six-month anniversary of his presidency, to this Wednesday, he made 33 false claims. Trump made the false claims in every possible venue: an interview with the Wall Street Journal ( 11 false claims ) to a campaign rally in Ohio ( five false claims ) to a speech to the National Boy Scout Jamboree ( four false claims ). Below is a list of every false claim Trump has made since his inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump is averaging 2.4 false claims per day. Why call them false claims, not lies?

        Robert Reich Pens Brutal List of 11 Trump Facts You Need to... Robert Reich Pens Brutal List of 11 Trump Facts You Need to Show Hard Headed Trump Supporters
 June 19, 2017 Tweet on Twitter
 Anyone who still supports Trump is simply in denial. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich decided to make a list of things Trump has done to help remind any remaining Trump supporters why the man is a crook. Throughout Trump ’s young presidency, Reich has been a vocal critic of Trump, and this may be his best work yet. The list was designed specifically to show hard headed Trump supporters the truth. On the taxpayer ’s dime. There ’s no denying Reich ’s points. After winning the election, Trump ’s true colors were put on display. Do you agree with Reich?

 About 40 Republican lawmakers have questioned or asked for more details about President Trump ’s decision to fire James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Most members of the party either supported Mr. Trump or avoided the issue, with two-thirds of House Republicans not commenting. Virtually every Democrat has called for a special prosecutor or independent investigation to examine the ties between Trump ’s associates and the Russian government.

        A new report by human rights organization Amnesty International found that President Donald Trump has, in fewer than 100 days in office, threatened human rights in at least 100 different ways. The Amnesty report includes a range of threats to human rights both inside the United States and in the rest of the world. Trump ’s immigration orders and 2017 and 2018 fiscal year budget proposals The Amnesty report serves as a stark warning to not normalize the real threats posed by Trump ’s presidency. There are many, many other examples of normalization of Trump ’s policies and rhetoric. This briefing is not exhaustive and the Trump administration ’s ongoing threats to human rights remain —

 No American president has taken office with a giant network of businesses, investments, and corporate connections like that amassed by Donald J. Trump. We spent two months building the dataset from public records, news reports, and other sources on the Trump family, his Cabinet picks, and top advisers — more than 1,500 people and organizations altogether. BuzzFeed News is the first news organization to publish such an exhaustive list of Trump ’s business interests, and we hope it will help you, the public, better understand the new administration. But Trump ’s web is so sprawling there are surely things we missed. Now, it contains just one: Connections.

        On Friday morning, President-elect Donald Trump took a new tack in his war on the Russia hacking issue. — Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) December 16, 2016 We made a tool that slips a bit more context into Trump's tweets. Or, for example, here's what it says when you go to Trump's tweet about how there were “ millions of people who voted illegally, ” which is why he lost the popular vote: Sometimes, we just add more context, like when Trump announced his pick of Rex Tillerson to serve as secretary of state. It's right there in the tweet now. And do n't hesitate to point to Trump tweets that could use a little explication. A data scientist just analyzed over a thousand tweets from Donald Trump's Twitter account.

        The Trump Accountability Project ( TAP ) is a resource for journalists, editors, and other news makers reporting on the Trump administration, which catalogues the anti- LGBTQ statements and actions of President Donald Trump and those in his circle. The Trump Accountability Project also includes other hateful rhetoric, discriminatory actions, and exclusionary worldviews of the incoming Trump administration. This information will equip journalists, as well as everyday people, to hold Trump and his administration accountable for their words and actions. It will also serve as a reminder that many in the incoming administration have blatantly pledged to dismantle the legal protections that LGBTQ people, as well as other communities, have achieved over the past several years.

        No modern president has jumped so directly from the world of business to the presidency as Donald Trump. And in so doing, Trump has refused to do as his predecessors have done: sever ties to the companies or financial interests that may pose, or present the appearance of, a conflict of interest. Special interests in Washington have caught on. Those seeking to curry favor with Trump are not only donating to his reelection campaign but holding fundraisers and galas at his resorts, private clubs and hotels – the proceeds of which benefit him and his family. To track this new influence-buying and presidential profiteering, the Center for Responsive Politics has created this page to track payments to Trump properties from Trump-related entities and beyond.

        The White House complex-- formally called the Executive Office of the President, or EOP-- is made up of more than a dozen offices and about 4,000 staffers who craft White House policy and support the president. It includes the White House itself, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and other federal agencies. The court held that these agencies are subject to public disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act, even if the White House itself is not. ” The Obama White House also initially refused to release a list of its visitors, as had previous administrations. The government redacted the names of some White House complex visitors, citing privacy reasons. Because the visitor logs and calendars are produced by the agencies themselves, meeting details might be mislabeled or incorrect.

        We are a nonprofit and nonpartisan investigative research project focused on corruption and wrongdoing by public officials. The main focus of our investigations has been President Trump ’s business network – a deeply suspicious network of corporations whose business operations defy normal economic logic. We have also investigated troubling evidence of wrongdoing by other government officials. We have proudly produced a series of explanatory videos about money laundering and Donald Trump ’s business activities. We provide support to groups investigating corruption and wrongdoing at local levels of government, without regard to party. Every   public official should be vetted and monitored by the citizens they represent.

        Trump ’s trust agreement is a little different. For one thing, it ’s not blind — Here ’s every time Trump has profited off the presidency. The mainstream media has covered Trump ’s conflicts doggedly. Moreover, foreign governments continue to hold leases on units in Trump buildings. Moreover, Trump ’s emoluments from foreign governments may extend beyond traceable cash payments. But Trump does n’t just rely on others to put money into his businesses Again, it ’s theoretically possible that these dollars are n’t ending up in Trump ’s bank account. Perhaps Trump ’s businesses have provided every working lunch and hotel room to the government free of charge. But given Trump ’s refusal to be transparent about that information, there is no way to confirm it. But Trump is n’t subject to the same restrictions.

        The Trump Administration We found 187 former lobbyists who work in the Trump administration. Heritage says the Trump administration, in just its first year, has enacted nearly two-thirds of its 334 policy recommendations. This rare government gig allows them to legally work for both industry and the Trump administration at the same time. Roughly 60 percent of the Trump administration officials included in our analysis have financial disclosure reports. Focusing on novel scandals alone can distract from the enormous scale of the Trump administration The pipelines between conservative policy think tanks — namely the Heritage Foundation and the Koch Brothers ’ Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce — and the Trump administration are clear, as is their effect on federal policy. Lifted. Withdrawn. Repealed. All reversed. “ The Heritage Foundation has touted its influence over Trump ’s agenda.
