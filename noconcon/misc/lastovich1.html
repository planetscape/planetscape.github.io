          PolyMet land swap left off defense bill
          Connor Shea
          Email The administrative land exchange between the Forest Service and PolyMet closed June 28, which finalized federal and private land permanently changing hands. We are disappointed that the land exchange amendment failed to be included in
          the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act. The land exchange was set to be cleared by Congress as a rider, or separate provision, on the NDAA. The PolyMet land exchange deal was not the only environmentally related rider
          to be excluded from the bill, according to Nancy Norr, chair of Jobs for Minnesotans and Minnesota Power regional development director. My understanding is that there were no environmental-related provisions in the final version of the
          bill.

          Tina Smith, PolyMet, and the Toxic Path to Pollution Senator Klobuchar was a co- sponsor of Smith ’s PolyMet amendment. The land was acquired under the Weeks Act, which prohibits open pit mining on the National Forest land that PolyMet
          wants to destroy. Smith ’s amendment will prevent federal courts from upholding these laws, repealing them in favor of   a foreign mining company. Tina Smith and the Glencore   Connection PolyMet is a cash-poor junior mining company that

          Sechin's requests that the US lift the sanctions, the dossier said. The dossier claims that Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort asked Page to be the liaison.

          Reporters were asking me, ‘ ’ ” The red sludge spill in Ajka, Hungary was clearly visible from space. “ — it did not. Life in these few villages will never be the same after this red-mud spill. Other less photogenic waste spills have killed
          more life or done more ecosystem damage. ” But other less photogenic waste spills and environmental disasters have killed more life or done more extensive ecosystem damage without attracting nearly the attention. The Tennessee coal ash
          spill two years ago released more than five times the volume of industrial waste. More environmental damage was done by a huge spill of cyanide-containing wastewater from a gold processing plant in Baia Mare, Romania in 2000. — and what not
          to fear — from red mud.
