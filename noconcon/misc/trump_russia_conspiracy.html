          Ukraine ’s election commission was shut down by a Russia-based hacking group, days before its presidential election. Germany discovered hackers had penetrated the network of the German Bundestag.
          October 2015: The Russian government tried to hack into the Dutch government ’s computers. December 2015: Russian hackers took over the control center of a Ukrainian power station. January 2016: A security firm announced its belief that
          Russian hackers were behind previous attacks on Finland ’s Foreign Ministry. Russian forces in Syria have appeared to deliberately target civilian areas of Aleppo. The information the Russian government obtained from the hack was used to
          focus on foreign officials, executives, and journalists, and steal Americans' credit card and gift card information.

          as Trump ’s campaign manager in March 2016. The Trump Administration and Manafort have both said that Manafort never worked for Russian interests. However, President Trump ’s staff now claims that “ Carter Page is an individual who the [

          The report concluded that:
          These attacks were ordered by President Putin;
          Russia ’s goals were to undermine faith in our democracy, to harm Secretary Clinton ’s chances of winning, and to help President Trump ’s election chances; and
          President Putin and the Russian Government favored President Trump. Russia will use   the lessons learned from their 2016 attack on our democracy to carry out   future attacks on both our democracy and other sovereign nations worldwide.
          It's clear that President Putin intends to do this again. The American people can not ignore Russia ’s actions against us, because doing so will leave our democracy vulnerable to the next attack.

          Russia: Influencing Trump &amp; His Team It's not just about Russia ’s 2016 election meddling, intervention in foreign countries, or past ties between them and President Trump ’s Administration. However, with President Trump in the White
          House, that will not be possible. In 2014, in response to Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, Sessions called for Russia ’s exit from the G8 and for sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, President Trump himself has made many comments while
          running for President, and since, that suggest an increasingly cozy relationship with Russia. For example, Trump said “ if you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody ’s doing some really
          great things?

          Hamilton 68 Version 2.0 – Today, we know much more about Russia ’s social media disinformation operations than we did in 2017 when we launched the Hamilton 68 dashboard. Meanwhile, Congressional and other investigations have compelled
          social media companies to release their own data on these operations. The dashboard was a first step towards countering the Kremlin ’s playbook through raising awareness on a single aspect of social media manipulation, and was never meant
          to be a complete rendering of Russian disinformation. We believe 2019 is the time to update and expand our analysis and information sharing on Russian disinformation. Currently, the archive hosts more than 10 million posts   connected to
          Russian and Iranian information operations on Twitter and Reddit, with additional data sets and features to be added shortly.

          No more information will be added. I made use of the methodology I learned while doing research for the now-moribund History Commons web resource. The main idea behind that method is to create" mashup" narratives of particular events using
          multiple news stories. If you're looking for great resources that are covering the same information this site did, try What The Fuck Just Happened Today? This site creates a reliable narrative of events that led up to the Trump victory in
          November — a “ schema ” of interrelated events and issues. Information is power. Information fuels activism. Become informed using the contents of this site, and use that information to become a more active and effective resister to the
          Trump / Putin autocracy.

          AMA-Finished My book House of Trump, House of Putin offers the first comprehensive investigation into the decades-long relationship among Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and the Russian Mafia that ultimately helped win Trump the White House.
          The story begins in the 1970s, when Trump made his first splash in the world of New York real estate, and ends with Trump ’s inauguration as president of the United States. That moment was the culmination of Vladimir Putin ’s long mission
          to undermine Western democracy, a mission that he and his hand-selected group of oligarchs and Mafia kingpins had ensnared Trump in, starting more than twenty years ago with the massive bailout of a string of sensational Trump hotel and
          casino failures in Atlantic City. This book confirms the most incredible American paranoias about Russian malevolence.

          By Marshall Cohen, Tal Yellin, Liz Stark
          For nearly two years, special counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone from President Donald Trump ’s campaign was involved. Investigators interviewed dozens of witnesses,
          obtained search warrants, and issued many subpoenas. Mueller ultimately brought criminal charges against 37 defendants – including six Trump associates. Multiple committees on Capitol Hill have also been investigating Russian interference
          and other related matters. With Democrats now running the House of Representatives, some of those probes are ramping up. These investigations have been conducted in secret, so many details are not publicly available. This interactive tracks
          the publicly known developments, and probably represents a slice of what has actually taken place behind closed doors.

          The Trump team ’s position … But …
          Trump “ stayed away ” from Russia

          This document ’s purpose is to compile all the info I have gathered from every available source ( Reddit, twitter, media, etc ) on the Trump-Russia connection. I ’m not out for conspiracy theories, anything without a reputable source will
          not be included. Anything in normal text is a story or report from normal reputable sources ( or direct tweets ). Sources are hyperlinked at the end of a given bullet point. Sometimes a link will be featured multiple times in the document
          in each relevant section or bullet points. This will hopefully give a clean overview, but the sources will provide you with the full picture of how extensive things are. Feedback may result in me typing up more extensive in document form as
          opposed to relying on sources to provide the bulk of the information.
