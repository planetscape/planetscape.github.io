          group of 1.6 million families, holds 42 % of the nation ’s wealth. More than 30 years later, it was $ 16,200. One of the culprits is Trump ’s policies. The report recommends both direct wealth taxes and a stronger inheritance tax to address
          extreme wealth inequality.

        <p>
            A new study details how American billionaires secretly spend massive amounts of money" to advance unpopular, inequality-exacerbating, highly conservative economic policies. Both as individuals and as contributors to Koch-type consortia, most U.S. billionaires have given large amounts money — and many have engaged in intense activity — to advance unpopular, inequality-exacerbating, highly conservative economic policies. " Billionaires have plenty of media access, but most of them choose not to say anything at all about the policy issues of the day. We know billionaires exert a lot of influence on American politics. This is largely the result of rapidly growing wealth dynasties and a rigged economy.

        <p>
          The broken promise that changed the Republican Party Why George H.W. Bush was the last of his kind. For George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st US president, that line was his pledge at the 1988 Republican National Convention when he accepted
          the party ’s nomination. When Bush took over the Oval Office, he inherited the consequences of his predecessor Ronald Reagan ’s supply-side or “ trickle down ” economics: massive budget deficits. Bush was a traditional “ country club ”
          Republican, whose relatively moderate economic and social beliefs contrasted with more right-wing conservatives who had supported Reagan. Watch the video above to learn more about the legacy of George H.W. Bush. You can find this video and
          all of Vox ’s videos on YouTube.
