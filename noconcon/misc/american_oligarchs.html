One in 5 have 0 or negative wealth. And, in the meantime, wealth is funneling to the wealthiest families in the country. Wealth concentration The report did n’t only highlight extreme wealth among families. More generally, the top 1 % of the U.S. — a group of 1.6 million families, holds 42 % of the nation ’s wealth. More than 30 years later, it was $ 16,200. One of the culprits is Trump ’s policies. The report recommends both direct wealth taxes and a stronger inheritance tax to address extreme wealth inequality.
