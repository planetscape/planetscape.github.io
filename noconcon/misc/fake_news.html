        To suss out the credibility of digital information, students should go beyond checklists and act more like fact-checkers
 By:
 Posted:
 June 7, 2018 Unlike the student participants in the study, the professional fact-checkers began their evaluations by opening new tabs in their browser. Takeaway: Encourage students to take the indirect route and begin their investigation of unfamiliar digital sources by leaving them. Students ’ more superficial evaluations of digital sources are evidence of what Wineburg and McGrew call the “ representativeness heuristic ” Communicate to students that more thorough evaluations, like those lateral reading allows, are crucial to establishing the trustworthiness of digital information. This will allow them to examine multiple sources of information faster.

    <p>
        They ’re eager consumers of news, but not yet discerning ones. The task of training students to be thoughtful news consumers is daunting and unwieldy. Compare articles about the same subject from different news sources: What information is highlighted? In a world where even the most respected newspapers are described as fake news, how do we help students know what sources count as reliable? Start by having students catalogue where they currently get their news Applying what they ’ve learn about bias, students can begin to assess the perspective and the mission of the news sources they read. Use a   checklist   created by   the News Literacy Project   to help students evaluate sources and detect fake news.

        Hamilton 68 Version 2.0 – Today, we know much more about Russia ’s social media disinformation operations than we did in 2017 when we launched the Hamilton 68 dashboard. Meanwhile, Congressional and other investigations have compelled social media companies to release their own data on these operations. The dashboard was a first step towards countering the Kremlin ’s playbook through raising awareness on a single aspect of social media manipulation, and was never meant to be a complete rendering of Russian disinformation. We believe 2019 is the time to update and expand our analysis and information sharing on Russian disinformation. Currently, the archive hosts more than 10 million posts   connected to Russian and Iranian information operations on Twitter and Reddit, with additional data sets and features to be added shortly.

    <p>
        Internet propaganda is such a big problem that it ca n't go un-addressed. What is propaganda? Non- propaganda is not the absence of bias Two other terms are key to understanding internet-based propaganda: misinformation and disinformation. Internet-based propaganda campaigns tend to involve both. This shift to misinformation makes the disinformation campaign more powerful, and is an intentional aspect of the online propaganda campaign. Propaganda is manipulative and social, not reasoned and intellectual. Propaganda hides its source. It's fake. Remember what I said above: resistance to propaganda must be a collaborative effort. In the current media landscape, social media is key to the spread of information, and thus disinformation. That's fine for process. That said, there are some clear things we can do to counter online propaganda.

 Stanford researchers find students have trouble judging the credibility of information online
 Stanford education scholars find many students have trouble judging the credibility of online news. Stanford researchers find students have trouble judging the credibility of information Students, for example, had a hard time distinguishing advertisements from news articles or identifying where information came from. The students were able to identify a traditional ad-- one with a coupon code-- from a news story pretty easily. Despite their fluency with social media, many students are unaware of basic conventions for indicating verified digital information. In another assessment, college students had to evaluate website credibility. The assessments were administered to students across 12 states.

        For satirical news, see List of satirical news websites. This is a list of fake news sites. These sites intentionally, but not necessarily solely, publish hoaxes and disinformation for purposes other than news satire. [ 5 ] These sites are distinguished from news satire ( which is humorous ) as they mislead and sometimes profit from readers' gullibility. [ 4 ] While most fake news sites are portrayed to be spinoffs of other news sites, some of these websites are examples of website spoofing, structured to make visitors believe they are visiting trusted sources like ABC News or MSNBC. Due to these back-and-forth complaints, the definition of fake news as used for such polemics became more vague.
