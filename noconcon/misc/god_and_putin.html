          Have Christian nationalists staged a" soft coup," with Trump as their figurehead? This right-wing Christian movement is fundamentally anti- democratic. Both Trump and the Republican Party are happy to support that desire. The strong
          association between Christian nationalism and Trump support-- no matter if someone is a Democrat or Republican-- suggests that Christian nationalism is important above and beyond political party. How do right-wing Christian evangelicals
          conceptualize politics and society? Is right-wing Christian support for Trump merely transactional or is it more than that? Christian nationalist support for Trump is in some ways transactional. Christian-nationalist support for Trump is
          also expressive. There is certainly an aspect of Christian nationalism that is authoritarian in nature.
