          Trump ’s campaign — with its sweeping promise The New World Leader of Conservatism. ”
          Notice how Putin ’s language about the West echoes the concerns expressed by the white Christian world of Trump ’s nostalgia voters. At the heart of Putin ’s case was an accusation of moral relativism. In the new war of beliefs, Putin is
          saying, it is Russia that   is on God ’s side. The West is Gomorrah … Putin is plugging into some of the modern world ’s most   powerful currents. In the culture war for the future of mankind, Putin is   planting Russia ’s flag firmly on
          the side of traditional Christianity. We ’re very similar people. Obviously he ’s talking about the idea that Russians would look like white people from Nashville. heaven ’s agenda.

          Farage ’s take is common among Europe ’s conservative populists. Bannon portrayed Putin as championing both nationalism and conservative cultural values. Putin ’s been quite an interesting character. He ’s also very, very, very intelligent.
          The depth of Putin ’s commitments to these movements is likely shallow: As Mudde noted, Russia has touted left-wing parties in Europe as well when that suits its interests.

          With One of Putin ’s Top Clerics: Strange Bedfellows at BGEA ’s World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians
          Metropolitan Hilarion meets Vice President Pence, with Franklin Graham presiding. Yesterday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence made headlines   for his appearance at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association ’s World Summit in Defense of
          Persecuted Christians, where he proclaimed Christians to be among the most persecuted people in the world. On the other hand, Russia ’s legal restrictions on Protestants should be a sticking point for American Christians. There is more than
          a little hypocrisy in Graham ’s allowing a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church to play an important role in his World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians
