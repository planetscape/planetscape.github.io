          All too often, our decision makers are bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry has limitless resources to invest in protecting and expanding their access and influence. The fossil fuel industry is deeply
          entrenched in our government – and this needs to change in order to hasten the transition to clean energy. The money going into politics from the oil, gas and coal industries gets huge returns in the form of subsidies back to fossil fuels.
          The mentality of needing more and more fossil fuel resources is also a big obstacle to change. Solutions
          Tell the story of fossil fuel money in Congress. Oil Change International is a 501(c)3 non- profit organization.

          ( The IRS disputes this. ) In 2017, for example, the IRS rejected only three out of 1,487 applications. The IRS ’ abdication of oversight stems from a trio of causes. Some IRS auditors say they were paralyzed. The IRS did that — only to
          have Congress shoot it down. Are Things at the IRS? A handful of IRS employees in Lerner ’s division had decided to improvise their own shortcut. The IRS Tried to Take on the Ultrawealthy. and the IRS ’ Rube Goldberg ( In IRS jargon, the

          | The amount of super PAC spending during the 2016 congressional primaries in which the first donor disclosure occurred after the primary election totaled $ 9 million. “ One tactic is the one Mountain Families PAC used. ( Among the 11 super
          PACs that together have spent at least $ 5.8 million since the primaries, all but one disclosed their donors on Oct. 15, when third-quarter FEC filings were due. ) A super PAC that does this would not have to disclose donors until well
          after the money is spent. ” asked one of them — until after the primary. Then they revealed their identity and dissolved the super PAC entirely. Here are more examples of PACs that have delayed disclosing their donors :
