        Within hours a new network of Russian-based troll accounts was identified, interacting regularly across the US and UK. And I'm genuinely sorry about it but there was simply no other way. While some of these accounts were shut down, others evolved. This is only part of the backdrop, though. Since 2006, the rate of new cases in Russia has increased by at least 149 percent and has been steadily increasing by 10 to 15 percent each year. More disinformation. In of itself, this message is disinformation- it simply is n't true. But in the Russian scenario this is meaningless. And it's essential to take into account All 18 accounts were human operated on this basis. But, based on the detailed analysis, they were clearly Russian-based troll farm accounts.

        The only real defense against bots and trolls is an intellectual offense, and we are n't ready for it
-- ( UTC ) The real problem is that the United States is one of the least intelligent nations in the developed world. They also found that our literacy was on the low end of developed nations. Arizona cut funding for K-12 by 36.6 percent from 2008- 2015. The same pattern is true for higher education. In 2015, humanities degrees were just under 12 percent of all degrees conferred. Our pathetic commitment to higher education is only surpassed by our poor media literacy. It ’s not just that we are n’t good at critical thinking; we do n’t even value it.

If we're talking Twitter, for example, there are a few behaviors that scream automated account. It will give you back a report that says whether or not an account is probably ( but not definitively ) automated. Realizing it's an automated account out to deceive you takes away its power to do so.

The next 15,000 followers from Devumi were more obviously suspect: Most of Devumi ’s best-known buyers are selling products, services or themselves on social media. Before he even graduated, his Twitter details were copied onto a bot account. The stolen social identities of Twitter users like Mr. Dodd are critical to Devumi ’s brand. In just a few years, Devumi sold about 200 million Twitter followers to at least 39,000 customers, accounting for a third of more than $ 6 million in sales during that period. The company also suspended Devumi ’s account on Saturday after the Times article was published online.

        Internet propaganda is such a big problem that it ca n't go un-addressed. What is propaganda? Non- propaganda is not the absence of bias Two other terms are key to understanding internet-based propaganda: misinformation and disinformation. Internet-based propaganda campaigns tend to involve both. Propaganda is manipulative and social, not reasoned and intellectual. Propaganda hides its source. It's fake. Be skeptical of the right things Remember what I said above: resistance to propaganda must be a collaborative effort. In the current media landscape, social media is key to the spread of information, and thus disinformation. That's fine for process. But for people, it's full of problems. That said, there are some clear things we can do to counter online propaganda.

        Computer Science &gt; Cryptography and Security Title: Automated Crowdturfing Attacks and Defenses in Online Review Systems Yuanshun Yao, Bimal Viswanath, Jenna Cryan, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao In this paper, we identify a new class of attacks that leverage deep learning language models ( Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs ) to automate the generation of fake online reviews for products and services. Using Yelp reviews as an example platform, we show how a two phased review generation and customization attack can produce reviews that are indistinguishable by state-of-the-art statistical detectors. Finally, we develop novel automated defenses against these attacks, by leveraging the lossy transformation introduced by the RNN training and generation cycle.

        The Same Twitter Bots That Helped Trump Tried to Sink Macron, Emilio Ferrara analyzed pro- Trump bots during the 2016 election and found a link to anti- Macron bots in 2017. Shutterstock
 Bots are a reality of political discourse. Of the nearly 100,000 users in the sample who participated in the MacronLeaks discussion on Twitter, 18,000 were bots, Ferrara said. When reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson directed Motherboard to the company's policy on bot accounts. Of a set of 15 bot accounts that Ferrara verified by hand, instead of with the algorithm alone, 13 had already been suspended by Twitter or deleted.

 Thousand of automated social network accounts are being used to spread fake news attacking centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron ahead of the French presidential run-off on Sunday ( 7 May ). Fake news often originating on Russian news outlets such as RT and Sputnik has for weeks targeted Macron, who is opposed to Russia-backed far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Sputnik France and RT France are more reliant than other news organisations on automated accounts. Still, neither Nimmo nor Oosterwoud could determine who was behind the automated accounts. Meanwhile Russian outlets are continuing their anti- Macron coverage, leading the candidate to ban Sputnik and RT from campaign events last week. US expert Nimmo added that educating the public on fake news and automated social media accounts would also have to be done.

 Former FBI agent Clint Watts testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday in Washington, D.C. Win McNamee / Getty Images When he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week, former FBI agent Clint Watts described how Russians used armies of Twitter bots to spread fake news using accounts that seem to be Midwestern swing-voter Republicans. One example, he says, is Trump's claim that he was wiretapped at Trump Tower by the Obama administration.

        Bots also sent out links to stolen emails damaging to Clinton campaign As part of the effort, which included Facebook and Twitter posts, the bots also shared WikiLeaks links to stolen DNC and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta emails that ended up damaging the Democratic nominee ’s campaign. The investigation is also looking into what role the news sites themselves may have played in the social media campaign, although as McClatchy notes, the bots could well have been pushing the stories without the involvement of the sites themselves. Earlier this week, FBI director James Comey confirmed that the agency was investigating whether members of the Trump campaign had any coordination with Russian operatives during the election.

        President Donald J. Trump loves his Twitter account. Almost all of this metadata is accessible through the open Twitter API. " For the sake of science, I turned tweets_analyzer loose on a few Twitter accounts to see what sort of information I could uncover. Presidential tweets For the sake of transparency, here's my Twitter data... Really. Tweet metadata from Guccifer 2.0, with no offset from UTC. Guccifer exclusively used the Twitter Web client to post. In almost all cases, there was no location associated with the accounts. To do more extensive fingerprinting of these accounts would most likely require licensing Twitter's raw stream. Fortunately, Twitter has made it a lot easier for users to strip location data from all of their posts, regardless of what device they make them from.

        Why Twitter bots? Our first finding was that getting followers on Twitter is surprisingly easy! However, the question remained: Can those thousands of followers   be converted to influence on Twitter? The idea being that if you follow more than one bot, content from the consortium of bots will increase proportionally in your Twitter stream. Bostonians following N bots. So at the end of the day, did the Twitter bots have influence in Boston? With a little over 800 Bostonian followers, our bots did not infiltrate Boston – and most Twitter users in Boston never interacted with one of our bots. Appendix: Twitter bots – Here, we provide a bit of context on Twitter bots.

        From Instagram likes to Twitter followers, there ’s a growing number of services that promise to bump up your numbers. At the start, I used Twitter ’s API to get a list of my 2,600 existing Twitter followers. ‘ buy twitter ’ with followers, cheap and review. This is what it looks like when you gain 4000 followers! This is Twitter carefully cleaning out and deleting fake accounts. Once my 4,000 newly purchased followers were onboard, I used the Twitter API to make another grab of my followers list, which I compared with my earlier list to generate a list of the 4000 fake twitter accounts now following me. This is a network graph representation of my Twitter followers after I acquired the bots. After a few months, some of my fake followers began disappearing.

        Tweets made by bots are related to a very narrow topic / context while humans ’ tweets are much more diverse ”. To use this approach to automatically identify bots, we crawled the latest tweets posted by a large sample of Twitter accounts. Thus, their Mean Distance is far greater than that of the bot ’s. But is it really? As mentioned earlier, around 15 % of Twitter users might be bots. Some of the content shared by these bots was fake and deceiving. These bots are not the real customers. Though meant for a better role in the social media, bots are now being targeted mostly as spam on Twitter. It is up to intelligent AI algorithms to help us phase out spam, bots and fake content from social media platforms.

        But all too often, automated and otherwise high-volume social media accounts exist to deceive. These accounts are the trolls we ’ve heard about for some time on Twitter. As you might expect, many accounts that are not bots or sockpuppets exhibit some of these traits. But the more of these traits an account displays, the more likely it is to be a disinformation account. Traits of bots and other high-volume disinformation accounts The sleepless account Accounts that are exclusively retweets ( or pretty close ) are n’t always bots, but if they exhibit some of the other traits here, there ’s a good chance they are. Tell-tale account   names Recent accounts Some users hold onto their false accounts for multiple campaigns. Disinformation accounts are almost certainly less likely to allow access to contacts.

        From spammers perspective, posting tweets from lots of fake accounts and that too in quick succession is a challenging task. As seen below, even celebrities that tweeted about Jio ( probably as part of influencer marketing strategy ) ended up posting the same tweets. Celebrities posting similar tweets support our hypothesis that spammers make little efforts to edit their tweets before   posting. For this, we use our proprietary text analytics algorithm called Semantic Similarity for clustering contextually similar tweets. A cluster of tweets that contextually speak about the pricing for Jio prime membership We analysed more than 50,000 tweets for# Presidentialle and# Jio and used Semantic Similarity technique to identify clusters of users that post very similar tweets multiple times.
