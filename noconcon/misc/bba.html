        <p>
          It ’s all about interest rates, and the fact that persistently low rates are making it harder But in some ways it makes more sense to say that the Fed — and other central banks around the world — chase interest rates. But with low rates,
          they ca n’t do that. That ’s because the deficit is actually helping to prop up interest rates, and keeping the Goldilocks rate from dropping deep into negative territory. But think what would happen to interest rates if we cut these
          programs. Central banks in Europe and Japan have experimented with negative interest rates, but they can only go so far. Today ’s 1.75 to 2 percent federal funds rate would be much more stimulative at 4 percent inflation than with the
          current 2 percent inflation.

        <p>
          Next up for GOP after bloated omnibus: a balanced-budget amendment? Jake Sherman reports in Politico ’s Playbook that House Republicans plan to introduce a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets when Congress returns from its
          current recess. This follows on the heels of their $ 1.3-trillion budget bill and their massive tax bill. Spending levels have already been agreed between the parties on that budget, too, with the second half of the $ 300 billion in
          additional spending from this month ’s compromise due to be spent. Perhaps Republicans hope to atone with the balanced budget amendment. Without a cap on taxation, a simple balanced budget amendment could end up forcing Congress to raise
          taxes rather than cut spending.

          House Republicans blew up the budget with tax cuts and spending increases. House Republicans are proposing a balanced budget   amendment to the Constitution that, though unlikely to pass, they hope will inoculate them from charges of being

          All U.S. government debt is denominated in U.S. dollar assets. If that is the case and the government continues to spend in deficit, then, yes, it puts itself in competition for resources that are already being employed by the private
          sector. Say the private sector and the federal government were going to play basketball and they were picking teams. Say further that the private sector is done picking its team but the government wants one more player. However, if everyone
          has already been picked, then the government can expand its roster only by stealing players from the private sector. The continued massive deficits were inflationary, crowded out private investment, and captured resources from the private
          sector. First, consider the fact that the government budget balance is equal to taxes minus government spending.

          Updated on 4.11.18 Congress took its first substantive action on a BBA in 1947 when the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced the measure but that momentum quickly stalled as the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was also considering the
          proposal, failed to take action. The first BBA proposal to pass a chamber of Congress was approved by the Senate in 1982 after 11 days of debate, but a companion measure in the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required in a
          236- 187 vote. The proposal then went to the Senate where it fell one vote shy of passage after two high profile defections: The Senate fell one vote short of approving a BBA again in 1997 after freshman Sen. Robert Torricelli ( D-NJ )
          reversed his campaign pledge to support the balanced budget amendment by voting no.

          the automatic stabilizers. That ’s why a balanced budget requirement is dangerous [ 4 ] but it temporarily increases the deficit. [ 7 ] These [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The economy ’s [ 12 ] Here is why:   Nearly all our states have balanced budget

          But do not celebrate a vote on the balanced budget amendment in Congress. A vote on the balanced budget amendment would be one of those “ pretend votes. They ’ll vote on the balanced budget amendment, it will fail, and they ’ll turn to you
          and say, “ A balanced budget amendment is a great idea, a necessary restraint on Congress to curb spending. But if they were actually serious about cutting spending, Republicans would be fighting to cut spending at every opportunity and
          then taking the case for the balanced budget amendment to the American people. When their votes mattered, Republicans increased government spending and the budget deficit. Now that their votes do n’t matter, they ’re talking about a
          balanced budget amendment.
