        <p>American democracy is at risk. Free expression is the cornerstone of any free society, and the First Amendment guarantees the right of the people to peaceably assemble. These bills working their way through state legislatures set steep
          penalties for different aspects of peaceful protest, and therefore would stifle dissent in this country. Every right we have depends on the right to speak out.

          Since ALEC decided to promote this legislation nationwide in January of 2018, critical infrastructure bills have been introduced in more than a dozen states. In all but two of those states an ALEC legislator has been listed as sponsor. In
          Illinois, bill co- sponsor Rep. Joe Sosnowski is a confirmed member of this powerful lobbying group. ALEC is n’t often at the forefront of legislative changes in blue states like Illinois, but with overwhelming support for this bill by
          Democrats in the Illinois House, that may be changing. but this bill is not it. Similar bills are still pending in other states, and the legislative season is almost over for the year. Read up on these bills, and do everything you can to
          speak out.

          But activists are facing threats to their right to protest in state legislatures across the country. The bills are not seeking to target protest generally, they are much more sneaky than that. But this was just the beginning. When voting on
          these laws, Oklahoma legislators made clear that these bills were a direct response to pipeline protests. Since that time, these bills have been introduced in nearly two dozen states, and enacted in five, though several more states are
          currently considering these bills. Generally, critical infrastructure bills share several common elements. Energy Transfer is one of several companies that has been lobbying for these bills. This session critical infrastructure bills have
          been introduced in thirteen states, primarily in the Midwest. Time is running out.

          Is this spate of anti- protest bills a coincidence? Of course, these legislators do n’t say their goal is to criminalize protest. But even if these bills are dressed up in language about public safety or the “ right to drive, ” their effect
          is singular: chilling protest. Protesting, on the other hand, and specifically protesting in the streets, is a fundamental constitutional right. Unlike constitutional laws, the proposed bills are n’t so carefully drawn. And lawmakers
          defeated anti- protest bills in Virginia and Michigan, recognizing that they were unconstitutional. Where Anti- Protest Bills Have Been Introduced in State Legislatures
          Legislators in states with robust protest activity should have one priority: listening to those voices ( even if, and perhaps especially when, they disagree with them ).

          The social media posts of American citizens who do n’t like President Donald Trump are the focus of the latest US military-funded research. The research also appears to be intended for use in the US homeland. In short, in 2017 the Trump
          administration moved IARPA ’s Embers social media surveillance program into the private sector under VTARC. Earlier this year, the ACLU filed several FOIA requests to a range of US government agencies over concerns that domestic social
          media surveillance had “ spiked ” under the Trump administration. The intensification of US social media surveillance coincides with the Trump administration ’s augmentation this year of the Pentagon ’s role in homeland security. US

          Anti- Trump Protesters Cleared of Charges Clarke ’s motion continues, “ said evidence I do think it ’s a serious violation. After losing outright in a case against the first six defendants last December, Kerkhoff dropped charges against all

          Civil liberties groups are pushing back against proposed legislation in Illinois that would allow police to dramatically expand the use of drones to monitor large gatherings of people and equip those drones with cameras with controversial
          facial recognition technology. The changes would allow police to use drones at any" large-scale public event" of 100 or more people without a warrant. One, put forth by proponents of expansion, would limit the use of facial recognition
          technology at events of more than 1,500 people and require police departments to maintain policies on reporting when drones are used. But the changes could also allow cops to use drones to monitor activities like large barbecues or sporting
          events. You're going to use a drone for that? Every public gathering? — specifically, It deters people from protesting. " " v

          One year later, the number of anti- protest bills has reached 58 in 31 states with no end in sight. Nine bills have already been introduced ( or-reintroduced ) in 2018 alone. Finally, 28 bills are currently pending in state legislatures.

          speech. ” A week after the finalization of this model policy, legislators in Ohio and Iowa introduced “ critical infrastructure ” bills. New bills concerning “ critical infrastructure ” are cause for alarm for several reasons. Those who are
          committed to challenging anti- protest legislation must consistently expose these groups and the strategic interests behind these bills.

          center of anti- pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017. Ohio is home to the controversial Rover pipeline, which is also owned by Energy Transfer Partners. Ohio ’s bill closely follows ALEC ’s framework. ’s operation. But regardless of intent,
          the highest-profile incidents of critical infrastructure sabotage in the state occurred along the Dakota Access pipeline. As evidenced by terrorist activities on pipelines and threats Benson noted that critical infrastructure is often empty

          Religious colleges would be able to bar openly same-sex relationships without fear of repercussions. Religious student groups could block people who do not share their faith from becoming members. The act governs federal aid to students and
          colleges, and the bill would let the government withhold that aid from colleges that violate the new provisions. When you think about Catholic universities, there are a lot of those, and quite a few of these universities would discriminate
          against same-sex student relationships. Although Ms. Stefanik was not a member of a single-gender group at Harvard, he said, “ she believes all schools should respect students ’ right to freely associate. ”

          This is a complete misrepresentation of what the Goldwater model does. Advertisement
          Scott is referring to Section 1(C ) of the model bill. The Goldwater model insists that when colleges create time, place, and manner restrictions on campus demonstrations, those restrictions must be “ viewpoint- and content-neutral. The
          Goldwater model does n’t restrict or dictate what professors say in the classroom at all. Actually, as I ’ve explained previously, Tennessee ’s campus free-speech law takes very little from the Goldwater proposal. In any case, Scott ’s
          claims about the Goldwater Institute ’s model campus free-speech bill are entirely false. The Goldwater model in no way dictates the conduct of teachers in the classroom.

          The Federalist Society was founded in 1980 by law students and faculty who felt alienated by the allegedly liberal atmosphere of law schools. Finally, the trend of students and local community members protesting reactionary speakers at
          universities has led to outcry about the “ intolerant left ” violating the free speech of the far right. But those who are so determined to protect the free speech of fascists, white supremacists, and other hate groups should be equally as
          concerned with protecting the right of dissidents to protest these viewpoints. Federalist Society speakers have often been met with protests from law student groups like the NLG, OutLaws, and If / While the rights of dissenting students are
          suppressed, the ability of far right speakers to disseminate hateful rhetoric is protected through claims of the right to free speech.

          legislature. It takes aim at environmental organizations Republicans have blamed for anti- pipeline protests that have become costly for local governments. The bill ’s author reportedly called it a response to the Dakota Access pipeline
          protests, aimed directly at organizers fighting to stop the Diamond pipeline, a project of Valero and All American Pipeline that would transport oil from Oklahoma to Tennessee. Protests against the pipeline have already begun and
          construction is scheduled for completion before the end of the year. Horinek traveled to North Dakota and was   arrested   with others   opposing the Dakota Access pipeline.

          The project at issue is the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline. The senators Wednesday heard arguments and allegations from the perspectives of tribal members who supported the North Dakota protest against the Dakota Access pipeline. And they
          heard how extremely limited law enforcement is in the extremely rural counties where the Keystone XL pipeline would be laid in South Dakota. TransCanada ’s route for Keystone XL avoids the Native American reservations of western and central
          South Dakota. Much like the North Dakota crossing for Dakota Access upstream from a drinking water system for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Keystone XL crossing on the Cheyenne River would be upstream from public water systems that

        <p>
          New Anti- Protesting Legislation: The current round of legislation — introduced by Republican lawmakers in 19 states — attempts to criminalize and penalize protesting in various ways. A bill in Indiana initially instructed police to clear
          protesters from highways by “ Washington ’s bill re- conceptualizing protests as acts of “ economic terrorism ” is another example of how non- violent protests are being re- classified as serious threats that deserves severe punishment. The
          recent surge of legislation targeting protesters and protest organizers is not the first time state legislators have attempted to neutralize and punish effective protests. Together we have the power to challenge and stop these bills before
          they are passed into law. At very least, these bills indicate that protesting has certainly become a threat again.

          Some good news from the Arizona Legislature: SB 1142, the bill that would have allowed protest organizers to be prosecuted for racketeering if a demonstration turned violent, is effectively dead. SB 1142 was based on some questionable
          claims. Levi Bolton, the executive director of the Arizona Police Association, and Ken Crane, president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, are both listed as supporters of the bill. When the bill passed the Senate last week, it
          sparked a national outcry, with many questioning whether or not it was even constitutional. But Mesnard says that was n’t what made him decide to kill the bill. I was less concerned about the national story, ” he says.

          would greatly increase penalties for environmental protesters. ’s office, the future of Sonnenberg ’s bill is uncertain. In Virginia, state lawmakers are considering an anti- protesting   law   that is apparently broader in scope. A bill

          unions to picket and easier for employers to hire workers to replace striking employees. One bill would increase fines against picketers to $ 1,000 per person   per day of a picket and $ 10,000 per day for an organization or union involved
          in the picket that is deemed to be an illegal mass picket. That bill passed on a mostly party-line vote of 57- 50.

          Now Ferndale Senator Doug Ericksen wants a law that would make protests a class C felony, if they become what he calls “ economic terrorism. The Ericksen bill creates a new crime called “ economic terrorism. But Ericksen was deputy director
          of the Trump campaign in Washington. As for Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant's call for a nationwide shutdown when Donald Trump is inaugurated in January, Ericksen says he's not sure if that qualifies as economic terrorism.

          With the passage of a new law earlier this year, North Dakota has become the first state to legalize law enforcement use of armed drones. Though the law limits the type of weapons permitted to those of the" less than lethal" variety-weapons
          such as tear gas, rubber bullets, beanbags, pepper spray and Tasers — the original bill actually aimed to ensure that no weapons at all were allowed on law enforcement drones. It also prohibited weapons aboard drones. "' I submitted with
          prohibition of any weapons,' he said.' The law says that law enforcement ca n't use drones weaponized with lethal weapons.' Weapons considered less than lethal can still be deadly.

          State Bills to Criminalize Peaceful Protest of Oil &amp; Gas Lawmakers in several states are introducing   bills that would increase criminal penalties for people who trespass" critical infrastructure" facilities, such as oil and gas
          pipelines, power plants, and petrochemical refineries. According to many of these legislators, these bills are a reaction to widespread protests of oil and gas infrastructure. Five states have enacted some form of these bills into law:
          North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Louisiana. Many of these bills are virtually identical. Nonviolent offenses, like   trespassing, are also already illegal in these states. People arrested for protesting oil and gas
          infrastructure-- before these" critical infrastructure" bills became   law in several states-- already   faced severe legal threats.

          Would heighten the penalties for protests near oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructure by creating the offenses of" criminal infrastructure facility trespass" and" critical infrastructure facility mischief. New penalties for protests

        <p>
          In 2013, the Illinois General Assembly passed landmark legislation protecting residents from government surveillance drones. is the active, continuous, and suspicion-less surveillance by drone of anyone and everyone at an event. a law
          enforcement agency may not use a drone to gather information. The circumstances in which police may use drones as a surveillance tool are limited to six situations:
          1. This protection from drone surveillance for individuals put Illinois at the forefront of an international debate over how to best protect the privacy rights of protesters. Current Illinois law regarding drone use likely meets these
          standards. The active, continuous, and suspicion-less surveillance made possible by drones interferes with these rights. Illinois should lead the way on the issue of drone surveillance by rejecting SB 2562.

          Targeting Campuses According to TPUSA ’s website, they have chapters at around 350 college campuses and approximately 64 chapters in high schools around the country. On Comedy Central ’s show, “ TPUSA ’s tactics are shady, to say the least.
          Across the country, TPUSA members film leftists without their consent, both on and off campus. TPUSA ’s connections to neo-fascist organizations and individuals. Lying about their interactions with their fellow students and their professors
          on campus is how TPUSA operates as an organization. Threats from Neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Islamophobes came from all over the country to Khan ’s inbox. In 2015, UIUC made national headlines over a newly established “ white student

        <p>
          In 2017, the Goldwater Institute introduced a model bill designed to ensure free expression within America ’s public university systems. We hope that public debate over these legislative proposals will strengthen freedom of speech at
          private colleges and universities as well. Yale ’s 1974 Woodward Report, The University of Chicago ’s 1967 Kalven Report, and the University of Chicago ’s 2015 Stone Report. It creates an official university policy that strongly affirms the
          importance of free expression, nullifying any existing restrictive speech codes in the process. It ensures that students will be informed of the official policy on free expression. Nowhere is the need for open debate more important than on
          America ’s college campuses.
