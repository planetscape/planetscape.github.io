<h2>1988</h2>
<p><blockquote>&ldquo;[T]here is no way to effectively limit or muzzle the actions of a Constitutional Convention.  The Convention could make its own rules and set its own agenda.  Congress might try to limit the Convention to one amendment or one issue, but there is no way to assure that the Convention would obey.  After a Convention is convened, it will be too late to stop the Convention if we donâ€™t like its agenda.&rdquo;</blockquote>
