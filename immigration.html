          Rights is a national immigrant empowerment campaign that will provide critical information to communities threatened by Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) and engage the broader American public in an urgent conversation about
          immigrant justice in our country. We Have Rights: When ICE is Outside our Doors
          ICE agents may come to your home looking for you or a loved one. This video outlines important information about what to do when ICE agents are inside your home, what your rights are, and what you can do to prepare for future immigration
          proceedings, should they occur. We Have Rights: If ICE Arrest Us
          ICE arrests increased by 30 % in 2017. This video will walk you through what your rights are if ICE arrests you.

          The Trump administration says it might hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement officers. A new app warns undocumented Americans ( or people who are rightfully worried they might be accused of being one ) about anti- immigrant raids so they
          can flee before the immigration forces come for them. Preferably, one of these should be a user who is also a lawyer. There are three kinds of raid reports – home raids, work raids, and traffic checkpoints. Only work raid and traffic
          checkpoint alerts will be sent out. February 12, 2017

          fix them. I'm a developer, how can I help? I'm not a coder, how can I help? There is no monetization strategy for this. How will the verified report reach the local communities impacted by the sweeps / raids? Will this be an automatic
          process or human-managed / vetted / supervised? We're currently working with advocacy groups and legal organizations to determine the processes for reporter verification and for verifying and sending out alerts. For people, by people | Join

          Regardless of your immigration status, you have guaranteed rights under the Constitution. Remember your immigration number ( “ A ” number ) and give it to your family. Do n’t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer.
          While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Never flee from an immigration checkpoint. only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status. You do not have to answer
          questions about your immigration status. An immigration officer can not arrest you without “ probable cause. If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. If you are over 18,
          carry your immigration documents with you at all times.

          Your rights If you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer if you can not afford one. Keep your hands where the police can see them. If you have been arrested by police, you have the right to make a local
          phone call. The police can not listen if you call a lawyer. Police officers do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy when performing their jobs, but the people they are interacting with may have privacy rights that would require you
          to notify them of the recording. Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, and they may not delete your photographs or video under any circumstances.
