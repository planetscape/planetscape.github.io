          law students with faculty supervision may spend a week on the ground at one of SIFI ’s four immigrant detention centers, Stewart, Irwin, LaSalle and Folkston. On the ground volunteers may participate in immigration court hearings to seek
          our clients ’ release from detention, conduct visits with current clients, and screen potential clients for representation. REMOTE VOLUNTEERS: Attorneys and law students may draft documents to seek clients ’ release from detention on bond
          or parole. By volunteering with SIFI, you can make a meaningful impact on the lives of our clients.

          One prominent example of an early family separation case was that of the youngest known separated child, MIRC represented every child placed in Michigan who was separated from their parents while the official zero-tolerance policy was in
          effect. This was not the end of the family separation crisis, though. MIRC continues to represent every child brought to Michigan to ensure their legal rights are protected. In addition to representing unaccompanied children placed in
          Michigan foster care, MIRC also represents Michigan parents facing other immigration-related legal situations that lead to family separation. This was not possible a year ago. ( Updated 6/21/19 ) Watch MIRC's online detainee locator.

          There are always helpers. There are 13,100 children imprisoned right now in federal custody — alone, without their families — facing horrifying neglect and abuse. Today, we will give them a defender who will step in front of the abuse they
          are …
          BRAWS ( Bringing Resources To Aid Women ’s Shelters ) Did you know that tampons and pads are not covered by food stamps or WIC, and are taxed at normal state tax rates? Did you know that – even though the majority of individuals in homeless
          shelters are women and children — most impacted by abuse, neglect and trauma — spend time in the foster care system. The world is a hard place, and pain is everywhere. The world is also a beautiful place and love is everywhere. May is
          National Foster Care month.

            The Central American children coming over the United States border are frequently fleeing violence, abuse, and crippling poverty. To learn more about this humanitarian crisis, visit our   unaccompanied children webpage. We work closely
            with
            the U.S. government agencies to ensure that the   the refugee children and families are treated humanely and fairly. The facilitates that hold unaccompanied children are generally not allowed to accept donated goods. Many of the children
            coming to the U.S. have family members domestically who can care for them. However, shelters and foster families are a critical need for other children and families. This would be run through your local child welfare organization, and
            would
            be required by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These children's rights should be protected.

            So it depends on what the children tell us. When we arrived, on Monday, there were approximately three hundred and fifty children there. There were over a hundred young children when we first arrived. Children described to us that they
            ’ve
            been there for three weeks or longer. And sometimes we hear about the littlest children being alone by themselves on the floor. Some of the children that we interviewed had been separated from their parents. There were children at this
            facility who came across with parents and were separated from parents. There were other children at the facility who came across with other adult family members. But they were not unaccompanied children. Things have always been horrendous
            in Border Patrol facilities, especially for children.

            The Washington Post ’s Nick Miroff explains what ’s at stake. Law enforcement officials worry that by publicly discussing the plan, Trump has undermined the chances of capturing those on the target list, as it could have pushed migrants
            with deportation orders underground. ’ ”
            Morgan and others at ICE insist the operation is crucial to uphold the integrity of the U.S. immigration system. ”
            Families can not be exempted, he said: The law must be applied fairly and equally. [ Before Trump ’s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass family arrests ] ”
            Morgan this week urged families with deportation orders to turn themselves in to ICE, and he said that operations targeting those who defy court orders would reinforce the administration ’s broader deterrent efforts.

            Jun 12, 2019 Ten years ago, 15-year-old May was taken from her hometown in Fuzhou, China — against her will — and brought to the United States. During her 8-month journey to the U.S.-Mexico border, May endured thirst, hunger, robbery, and
            sexual assault as she was handed off from stranger to stranger. When she finally reached the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration authorities identified her as an unaccompanied child and sent her to a children ’s facility in Chicago.

            Right now in McAllen, Texas hundreds of migrants are locked up in what are akin to disaster relief camps the day after an earthquake. This is the fourth child who ’s died in government custody in the last 6 months.

            the lawyers arrived, federal officials said that more than 350 children were detained at the facility. Some sick children were being quarantined in the facility. Among the guidelines set under the legal settlement are that facilities for
            children must be “ safe and sanitary. ” “

            interned. While some kinds of camps were understood to be harsher, after World War What kind of conditions can we expect to develop in these border camps? We have yet to discover what those will be for these American border camps. The
            death
            camps were still two years away. The United States now has a vast and growing camp system. Is it possible this growth in the camp system will be temporary and the improvised border camps will soon close? Once there are concentration
            camps,
            it is always probable   that things will get worse.

            For more than thirty years, LSS-SW has served some of the world ’s most persecuted people living right here in Tucson and Phoenix. Violence and armed conflict chase millions of people from their homes, their families, and their countries,
            forcing them to seek safety in other countries around the world. Every year, the President and the State Department identify global regions in which people have an exceptional need for protection outside of their home countries. With
            volunteers and community Welcome Teams, LSS-SW builds self-reliant foundations for approximately 1,000 refugees each year.

            About this Event
            Friends, we lamentably continue to witness the medical negligence that asylum-seeking families face while in ICE custody. As we receive hundreds of families every day, we see that they experience illnesses that could have been treated
            under ICE's care, but ICE did NOTHING. Join us on July 2nd at 9 AM in front of ICE's offices in downtown Phoenix in order to fight against the inhumane conditions that exacerbate the lives of people legally seeking asylum! Tags

            Inspired by the Tiffany Haddish interview with David Letterman on My Next Guest No Introduction, Immigrant Families Together has pledged to send 100 sets of duffel bag rolling suitcases and backpacks to our partners in El Paso. The reason
            we ’ve taken this commitment on is when all your worldly belongings are in a trash bag you ’re treated like trash and feel like trash. Our Director, Julie Schwietert Collazo witnessed this first hand last fall. Tiffany Haddish said, “ I
            remember when I got my first suitcase, I felt like I was a traveler, like I had a purpose, like I ’m a person, like I ’m not garbage, I got this I ’m not garbage.

            Welcome to La Posada Providencia! La Posada Providencia, is an emergency shelter for men, women and families who flee to the United States due to political oppression, natural disaster, and other life-threatening actions in their native
            countries. They seek legal asylum or other legal recourse to begin new lives in this country. Since 1989, La Posada has provided resettlement assistance to thousands of people from close to 100 different countries. Located in the lower
            Rio
            Grande Valley of South Texas, La Posada provides a stabilizing support system for immigrants and asylum seekers as they wait for their cases to be adjudicated before the U.S. Immigration Court and for asylees as they take steps to toward
            achieving permanent resident status.

            Time: 10:00 a.m. The narrative that refugees and immigrants are criminals is not true. Annunciation House and our partner organizations and faith communities have been providing hospitality to thousands of these families every week. A
            refugee mother from Honduras forcibly separated for over 115 days from her three and four-year-old daughters by Border Patrol Agents on October 11, 2018. 2. A newly-arrived refugee parent who fled violence and persecution in Central
            America
            to lawfully seek asylum in the United States. 3. A former refugee who was granted asylum in the United States and who has since become a valued member of our vibrant border community. Following the press conference, the speakers — along
            with Annunciation House Executive Director Ruben Garcia and Legal Coordinator Taylor Levy — will have limited availability for individual interviews with members of the press.

          <p>
            We are currently handling an influx of cases related to the Trump administration “ zero tolerance ” policy that has created the family separation crisis. We are engaged in the release of refugee parents from detention, and reunion with
            their separated children. * * To support families in need please donate here. Funds received will help cover bail bonds for families who can not afford it, travel expenses for family members to visit detained children, travel expenses of
            released refugees to their final destination, purchase of mobile phones and emergency living expenses,   and other expenses that refugee families may incur in recovering from the nightmare of the Administration's zero tolerance policy.
            Donations are also used to pay for the travel of lawyers and paralegals to help defend refugees and their children in detention centers scattered across the country.

            We also are spending so much tax payer money on Mexico and Cuba citizens flooding our boarders. Just think of the money Clinton has spent running for 2 years and maybe a 3rd. That ’s the money needed for a good cause. Not spending 500
            million at the chance to get a 4 year job that only pays 2 million a year. That ’s tax money and we have citizens who have been here dying we do n’t help. If not we take over Mexico and fix issue. Again they who complain should be taxed
            and if it means their entire pay check so be it. Pay the bill. Those who are n’t upset with this but who are upset with the rampant illegal issue. We do n’t want to spent our tax money on that.

            The Trump administration says it might hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement officers. A new app warns undocumented Americans ( or people who are rightfully worried they might be accused of being one ) about anti- immigrant raids so
            they
            can flee before the immigration forces come for them. Preferably, one of these should be a user who is also a lawyer. There are three kinds of raid reports – home raids, work raids, and traffic checkpoints. Only work raid and traffic
            checkpoint alerts will be sent out. February 12, 2017

            ABOUT US
            Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley is the charitable branch of the Diocese of Brownsville. The architecture of the humanitarian respite center should reflect the generosity and warmth of the Rio Grande Valley community. We should
            provide spaces of welcome and support to help the most vulnerable regain hope and dignity for their difficult journeys ahead. The center should provide support for refugees and volunteers alike, educating and raising awareness of the
            ongoing issues with the immigrant community. We believe in the generosity of the people of the Valley and beyond, Catholics and non- Catholics, as a continuing sign that affirms human dignity and compassion.

            On World Refugee Day, we ’re reminded that the refugee crisis has grown in recent years; there are over 70 million people displaced worldwide today Who exactly is a refugee? How do other countries treat refugees? The UNHCR has great
            resources that introduce who refugees are, and discusses the differences between refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers. If you do n’t have miles to donate, you can also donate cash to help refugees and asylum seekers reunite with family.
            Together, a few examples of nonprofits with strong service programs to help refugees and asylum seekers. Urge your country to stand with refugees by contacting your elected representatives. Donate items to a refugee donation center.
            Volunteer at a refugee non- profit or agency Fostering a refugee child through our partner LIRS is another way to help.

            announced
            plans to cut funds to educational, legal and recreational programs for children detained at the border. Donate to Save the Children Save the Children staff are currently at the border providing lifesaving care to children who ’ve endured
            trauma, dangerous voyages and so much more. Save the Children is a leader in this space. They ’ve protected and advocated for vulnerable children for 100 years now. The center offers children a safe space to play, relax, read – Though it
            can sometimes feel like it, we ’re never voiceless when it comes to helping children.

            BETTER, BOLDER, BADDER, BAJI. THE REAL CRIME
            MASS CRIMINALIZATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES Everyday, people of color in the United States are being criminalized for their economic condition, their race, their migrant status, gender and so much more. There is a pandemic of mass
            criminalization that is ravaging our neighborhoods and our society. Structural racism and oppression would have us believe that we are inherently flawed, that we are criminals. However, the real crime is demonizing, criminalizing and
            imprisoning millions of young men and women, relegating them to the margins of society as disenfranchised, unemployable pariahs. African Americans and other communities of color, including immigrants are being profiled, surveilled, locked
            up and locked out of society.

            Educators for Migrant Justice is ESGTI ’s flagship grassroots advocacy campaign fighting to end pension fund complicity in the migrant abuse crisis. We achieved our first campaign win in November when we successfully pushed the country ’s
            second largest pension fund, the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System ( CalSTRS ) to divest from for-profit prison companies CoreCivic and GEO Group over their human rights abuses of migrants and other detainees. The campaign has
            since expanded to the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System ( CalPERS ) as well as the Oregon Public Employees ’ Retirement System. CalPERS Members: Take Action!

            I would never recommend people put that much trust in me. With open-source software, instead of having to trust a few unknown developers, you are trusting a community of developers that are monitoring, auditing, finding issues, and
            helping
            fix them. I'm a developer, how can I help? I'm not a coder, how can I help? There is no monetization strategy for this. How will the verified report reach the local communities impacted by the sweeps / raids? Will this be an automatic
            process or human-managed / vetted / supervised? We're currently working with advocacy groups and legal organizations to determine the processes for reporter verification and for verifying and sending out alerts. For people, by people |

            Families are arriving in our border region desperate for our help. They have traveled hundreds, if not thousands of miles to flee extreme conditions that imperil their survival. Immigration authorities are releasing these families and
            giving them the right to live in the U.S. while they await the outcome of their application for asylum. They urgently need money to be able to unite with family members elsewhere in the country. Our faith community is collecting funds to
            pay for these families ’ bus and airline tickets and other immediate transportation needs. As people of faith, we are compelled to welcome the stranger. In addition to keeping them in your prayers, your donation today can have a big
            impact
            in the lives of these vulnerable families. Your generosity and heart will help these families on their journey.

            Freedom University is a modern-day freedom school for undocumented students in Atlanta, Georgia. OUR HISTORY
            Freedom University opened its doors in 2011 following the passage of Georgia Board of Regents' Policy 4.1.6, which bans undocumented youth from attending Georgia's top public universities, and Policy 4.3.4, which bans undocumented
            students
            from in-state tuition. And while more than 20 states allow undocumented students to attend public universities or qualify for in-state tuition, Georgia is the only state to ban DACA students from admission to its top universities and from
            in-state tuition. WHAT WE DO
            To fulfill the human right to education of undocumented youth in Georgia, Freedom University welcomes undocumented students ages 17- 25 and provides them with free college preparation courses in a safe learning environment.

            Families who have been admitted into the United States as asylum-seekers need to travel from Phoenix to their families or sponsors across the country while they await immigration proceedings. Instead, ICE agents drive buses of families
            directly to local churches who indicate they have the temporary capacity to receive the families and assist with travel arrangements. These families need basic necessities, such as food, bathing, and medical attention. Furthermore, these
            families are required to report to immigration offices across the country to proceed with the asylum-seeking process, despite not being provided with organized travel arrangements. However, these organizations can no longer keep up with
            the
            demand, and ICE has started repeatedly and consistently dropping off busloads of asylum-seeking families at Phoenix bus stations.

            is
            a critical shortage of non- profit immigration legal services in greater Boston, most especially on the side of Boston Harbor where most of our Central American community resides. Some of the non- citizens who most need immigration law
            services are least able to pay for access to justice, and we are ready to meet their needs as soon as possible.

            We identify, contact, defend and uplift the voice of refugee women jailed in the 8 detention facilities along the lower Texas border that we service. We support family members in traveling the country to make contact with their children
            in
            government hans,   and provide travel and emergency living expenses for family members released from detention. We fund the traveling expenses of US-based family members visiting detained children, and provide travel expenses for detained
            mothers and children upon release. We fund emergency food, clothing and other living expenses for refugee women, their children,   and other asylum seekers. We work pro- bono representing Central American refugee families fleeing violence
            and other threats in their home countries who are seeking asylum. Our clients are refugee women arrested by ICE along the lower Texas border.

            mostly immigrant farm workers. Today, courageous members of the Border Angels are honoring the legacy of my father by making a powerful statement against inhumanity and oppression endured on our border by innocent immigrants. Paul F.

            After this meeting I feel that I will be able to sleep tonight. An attorney is really important in an immigration case, especially if you are in detention. In this facility everything is hard if you do n’t have a lawyer I want to
            appreciate your effort towards my asylum process. You have given me a good advice that I have to thank you for all that you have done for me. Madam I just want to inform you that I was granted a bond. And I will continue my court
            proceedings outside. – Asylum seeker from Guinea

            Regardless of your immigration status, you have guaranteed rights under the Constitution. Remember your immigration number ( “ A ” number ) and give it to your family. Do n’t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer.
            While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Never flee from an immigration checkpoint. only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status. You do not have to answer
            questions about your immigration status. An immigration officer can not arrest you without “ probable cause. If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. If you are over 18,
            carry your immigration documents with you at all times.

            Founded in 1987, Las Americas is a homegrown non- profit dedicated to serving the legal needs of low income immigrants, including refugees and asylum seekers, victims of crime, and families seeking reunification. Las Americas ’ attorneys
            and staff are committed to providing legal representation to those who otherwise would not be able to afford it. The El Paso port-of-entry sees the second highest number of people crossing into the United States by land, second only to
            San
            Diego. Since our inception, Las Americas has provided representation to more than 30,000 low-income immigrants in El Paso. Las Americas ’ clients come from all over the world, and our staff has helped clients from countries as far as
            Burma
            and Cameroon.

            March for Immigrant Justice
            From" zero tolerance" to the separation of families and detention of 15,000 + children, and the blocking of ports of entry to asylum-seekers-current immigration policies are inhumane, racist and unjustified, and must be loudly rejected.
            In
            June of 2018, we rallied and marched in 60 + cities nationwide and 20 + cities worldwide to protest family separation. Since then, separations are down, but THEY ARE STILL HAPPENING along with a steady stream of other horrors. Join

            day, community bond funds raise money to free our friends and neighbors from immigration detention and make sure they are able to work on their case from a place of freedom. To contribute to a local community bond fund that is paying for
            immigration bond, see the list below. To contribute to the centralized   2019 Freedom Spring Fund that will be distributed across all immigration bond funds on the below list, DONATE HERE. Note: To return to the full directory of the

            Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route: Natalia and Mario ’s story
            Imagine escaping horrific violence and arriving to a new country with merely the clothes on your back. This is the situation for thousands of people fleeing organized crime and gang violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America and
            seeking safety in neighboring countries. When they arrived, Natalia and Mario faced many challenges. Asylum Access established Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route to create more welcoming communities for refugees. The Hospitality Route
            creates movement among all sectors of society to share the message of “ welcome ” to refugees in Mexico. Natalia and Mario were some of the first beneficiaries of the Hospitality Route program.

            For 10 years, the New Sanctuary Coalition has been led by and for immigrants to stop the inhumane system of deportations and detentions in this country. New Sanctuary springs from New York ’s faith-based and social justice communities and
            forms a unique family of citizens and immigrants, bound by a love of humanity and mutual respect. Accompaniment   provides citizen-witnesses of ICE ’s behavior, emotional support for immigrants and also establishes that our friends have
            strong ties to the local community, a fact appreciated by immigration judges. Altogether, NSC has helped thousands of immigrant families.

            reunite families separated by the administration's inhumane" zero-tolerance" policy. Since the launch of Project Corazon, we have expanded our mission, mobilizing thousands of lawyers to defend the rights of immigrants and their families.
            We're fighting to reunite and defend the rights of immigrant families. Working with a network of immigration legal services providers, volunteer lawyers, bilingual interpreters, and law firms across the country, Project Corazon is
            fighting to reunite separated families, defend the rights of detained immigrants, and provide assistance to immigrants recently released from detention.

            We resist policies and policy proposals that target and aim to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and discriminate against Black, Indigenous, Muslim, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ people. What is a sanctuary city? A “ sanctuary city ” means
            that there are policies in place to limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration officials ( ICE ), to protect basic human and civil rights of the city ’s residents. However, because there are some loopholes in our
            sanctuary policy and because there are so many federal agencies in DC that are not obligated to follow it, many immigrant DC residents – documented and undocumented – are being unlawfully deported. A sanctuary city should not comply with
            destructive immigration and registration policies.

            THE ATROCITIES BEING COMMITTED AGAINST IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES!!! There are good people in this world yes, some people DO care. History will point to this army of fierce hearted strangers who linked arms and marched toward the
            world ’s pain – who sacrificed for forgotten little ones they will never meet because there is no such thing as other people ’s children. Our goal yesterday was to raise $ 240,000 for emergency response and long-term legal accountability
            for the child detention crisis. You stopped your day and the world for these children.
