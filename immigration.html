          The Central American children coming over the United States border are frequently fleeing violence, abuse, and crippling poverty. To learn more about this humanitarian crisis, visit our   unaccompanied children webpage. We work closely with
          the U.S. government agencies to ensure that the   the refugee children and families are treated humanely and fairly. The facilitates that hold unaccompanied children are generally not allowed to accept donated goods. Many of the children
          coming to the U.S. have family members domestically who can care for them. However, shelters and foster families are a critical need for other children and families. This would be run through your local child welfare organization, and would
          be required by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These children's rights should be protected.

          Fighting for Survivors of Child Labor Trafficking
          Jun 12, 2019 Ten years ago, 15-year-old May was taken from her hometown in Fuzhou, China — against her will — and brought to the United States. During her 8-month journey to the U.S.-Mexico border, May endured thirst, hunger, robbery, and
          sexual assault as she was handed off from stranger to stranger. When she finally reached the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration authorities identified her as an unaccompanied child and sent her to a children ’s facility in Chicago.

          Time: 10:00 a.m. The narrative that refugees and immigrants are criminals is not true. Annunciation House and our partner organizations and faith communities have been providing hospitality to thousands of these families every week. A
          refugee mother from Honduras forcibly separated for over 115 days from her three and four-year-old daughters by Border Patrol Agents on October 11, 2018. 2. A newly-arrived refugee parent who fled violence and persecution in Central America
          to lawfully seek asylum in the United States. 3. A former refugee who was granted asylum in the United States and who has since become a valued member of our vibrant border community. Following the press conference, the speakers — along
          with Annunciation House Executive Director Ruben Garcia and Legal Coordinator Taylor Levy — will have limited availability for individual interviews with members of the press.

          The Trump administration says it might hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement officers. A new app warns undocumented Americans ( or people who are rightfully worried they might be accused of being one ) about anti- immigrant raids so they
          can flee before the immigration forces come for them. Preferably, one of these should be a user who is also a lawyer. There are three kinds of raid reports – home raids, work raids, and traffic checkpoints. Only work raid and traffic
          checkpoint alerts will be sent out. February 12, 2017

          resources that introduce who refugees are, and discusses the differences between refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers. If you do n’t have miles to donate, you can also donate cash to help refugees and asylum seekers reunite with family.

          faceted needs of our immigrant community members, including through legal, social, educational, and medical services. The OTG Advocates work primarily with families detained at the Berks detention facility. Aldea ’s legal efforts are
          supported by volunteer attorneys and advocates who specialize in immigration law and who have years of expertise representing under-served immigrant communities. Although Aldea ’s legal services are open to all low income individuals, Aldea
          assists several specific categories of individuals:
          Unaccompanied minors and minor immigrant children.

          criminalization that is ravaging our neighborhoods and our society. Structural racism and oppression would have us believe that we are inherently flawed, that we are criminals. However, the real crime is demonizing, criminalizing and
          imprisoning millions of young men and women, relegating them to the margins of society as disenfranchised, unemployable pariahs. African Americans and other communities of color, including immigrants are being profiled, surveilled, locked
          up and locked out of society.

          I would never recommend people put that much trust in me. With open-source software, instead of having to trust a few unknown developers, you are trusting a community of developers that are monitoring, auditing, finding issues, and helping
          fix them. I'm a developer, how can I help? I'm not a coder, how can I help? There is no monetization strategy for this. How will the verified report reach the local communities impacted by the sweeps / raids? Will this be an automatic
          process or human-managed / vetted / supervised? We're currently working with advocacy groups and legal organizations to determine the processes for reporter verification and for verifying and sending out alerts. For people, by people | Join

          Welcome to New Sanctuary Coalition
          For 10 years, the New Sanctuary Coalition has been led by and for immigrants to stop the inhumane system of deportations and detentions in this country. New Sanctuary springs from New York ’s faith-based and social justice communities and
          forms a unique family of citizens and immigrants, bound by a love of humanity and mutual respect. Accompaniment   provides citizen-witnesses of ICE ’s behavior, emotional support for immigrants and also establishes that our friends have
          strong ties to the local community, a fact appreciated by immigration judges. Altogether, NSC has helped thousands of immigrant families.

          We resist policies and policy proposals that target and aim to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and discriminate against Black, Indigenous, Muslim, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ people. What is a sanctuary city? A “ sanctuary city ” means
          that there are policies in place to limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration officials ( ICE ), to protect basic human and civil rights of the city ’s residents. However, because there are some loopholes in our
          sanctuary policy and because there are so many federal agencies in DC that are not obligated to follow it, many immigrant DC residents – documented and undocumented – are being unlawfully deported. A sanctuary city should not comply with
          destructive immigration and registration policies.
