          By this definition, the new child camp established in Tornillo, Texas, is a concentration camp. Well, this is my worry about the camps at the border. And they definitely started as refugee camps. So these communities were shoved together in
          these same camps. They evolved into these enemy alien camps. But there are other examples. First of all, this is just limiting it to U.S. citizens, so does that OK concentration camps for other people? This is the kind of stuff we see where
          you end up with concentration camp regimes. And there were also almost four decades of concentration camps, things that were called concentration camps — civilian detention on the basis of identity — that happened before that.

          By Rebecca Klar-06/30/19 02:15 PM EDT A federal judge   has ordered U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) to allow medical   professionals into   detention facilities holding migrant children, CNN reported Sunday. The centers are the
          subject of a lawsuit   regarding the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement and reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions at detention centers. Prosecutors had requested immediate action to address conditions they said threaten the wellbeing of
          children. " The children, including infants and expectant mothers, are dirty, cold, hungry and sleep-deprived," prosecutors said, referring to conditions at detention centers, including one in Clint, Texas.

          Video shows border patrol agents reviving migrant teen 00:48
          Last week, lawyers asked US District Judge Dolly Gee to hold President Donald Trump's administration in contempt and order immediate improvements at the facilities. The lawyers are part of a team of doctors and advocates that warned last
          week of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at Customs and Border Protection facilities in Texas following visits to the facilities. The detention centers have become a political volleyball, with critics likening them to
          concentration camps and torture facilities, while supporters say they're necessary to an effective immigration policy. The Court has already issued several orders that have set forth in detail what it considers to be violations of the
          Flores Agreement," Gee wrote in her Friday ruling.

          The facility has been a hub for detained children in border patrol custody in New Mexico and West Texas since 2014. The lights are glaring and sleepless children are crying. She said she has been there nearly three weeks. Her declaration
          was filed with a court in Los Angeles that oversees a long-standing settlement agreement over custody conditions for migrant children caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Some of the children traveled alone to the U.S. It is obvious that
          the dignity and well-being of children is not even an afterthought in the design of the center, ” Sevier said. The flu was widespread and children who got sick were sent to a special cell. It ’s very hard for all of us to be here. The
          children are not named in the declarations provided to the court.

          A country exemplifies itself and is judged by not just how it treats it ’s own children, but ’s children in its care and custody. We are nothing but a cruel and fraudulent mirage. We are a grass roots group comprised of citizens from all
          walks of life who are outraged at the trea... tment of children in our government established detention centers. Your tax dollars are being spent to the tune of $ 800 a night per child, and they ca n’t afford to give the kids the most basic
          necessities? Also, many of the children have family members in the US. Help us help the children.

          Debbie Nathan
          June 28 2019 Many immigrant rights advocates call the program the “ Migrant Persecution Protocols. ” Most migrants stuck in Mexico under the MPP say they are deeply fearful about being there. Of those cities, three or four will be chosen to
          host courts in tents, the source said. Mexican media also reported that migrants in Eagle Pass, Texas, will be sent across the border to Piedras Negras and to immigrant court in Laredo. It is still not clear if Yuma or Laredo will be chosen
          for tent courts: Migrants might still be sent to traditional courts elsewhere in Texas and Arizona.

          A new policy may strip unaccompanied minors of their protected status. Under this new policy, which rescinds an Obama-era memorandum, USCIS officers will independently determine whether an individual was an unaccompanied minor when they
          filed their application. At that time, asylum officers made “ independent factual inquiries ” to determine whether individuals filing applications met the criteria to be designated as unaccompanied minors and were thus under the
          jurisdiction of USCIS. The decision dealt with whether USCIS or an immigration judge has initial jurisdiction over the asylum application of an individual who was previously determined to be an unaccompanied minor but had turned 18 before
          filing their application. Unaccompanied minors are currently exempt from the standing one-year deadline to file asylum applications.

          children in a massive compound tucked behind a chain link fence. It really still is a prison for children. There were n't children playing. These were children who were being marched like little soldiers, like little prisoners, from one
          place to another. Children play soccer at the Homestead shelter for unaccompanied minors. Conditions in Homestead are not favorable for children, she said. Children do not belong in detention centers.

          reunited. Bonds for detained immigrants start at $ 1,500, and can be as high as $ 80,500. One of the mothers Immigrant Families Together bonded out has already been granted asylum. Another was elected president of the PTA at her child ’s
          school. Last year, President Trump said of immigrant children: “ They ’re not innocent. ” ’s “ ’ ” If you feel outraged now, stay outraged until every last child is reunited with his or her parents and family separation is abolished. So
          much can change in a year.

          Tents stand at the U.S. Border Patrol station where lawyers reported that detained migrant children were held unbathed and hungry on June 25, 2019 in Clint, Texas. A group of lawyers on Wednesday night asked a federal judge to hold the
          Trump administration in contempt and to order immediate improvements to conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities where children are being held. Here's a look inside the controversial Clint, Texas, facility where migrant
          children have been detained The visits were negotiated with Customs and Border Protection because the team is monitoring government compliance with the Flores settlement. Customs and Border Protection has pushed back against the allegations
          raised by lawyers, doctors and advocates last week, and reiterated that its facilities are not fitted to care for children.

          One prominent example of an early family separation case was that of the youngest known separated child, MIRC represented every child placed in Michigan who was separated from their parents while the official zero-tolerance policy was in
          effect. This was not the end of the family separation crisis, though. MIRC continues to represent every child brought to Michigan to ensure their legal rights are protected. In addition to representing unaccompanied children placed in
          Michigan foster care, MIRC also represents Michigan parents facing other immigration-related legal situations that lead to family separation. This was not possible a year ago. ( Updated 6/21/19 ) Watch MIRC's online detainee locator.

          There are always helpers. There are 13,100 children imprisoned right now in federal custody — alone, without their families — facing horrifying neglect and abuse. Today, we will give them a defender who will step in front of the abuse they
          are …

          shelters are women and children — most impacted by abuse, neglect and trauma — spend time in the foster care system. The world is a hard place, and pain is everywhere. The world is also a beautiful place and love is everywhere. May is

            Rescue stories I am happy they are safe and they are in a good school. The Al Sharaa family arrived in the U.S. in December 2015 as refugees and are thriving in their new home in Dallas. Meet the Al Sharaas When I saw the refugees, I
            could
            n’t refuse them. so that is why I employ them. Zulu Likichio is proud to count South Sudanese newcomers among her employees and customers at her Quality Restaurant in the Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in Uganda. Meet Zulu I was scared to
            be
            killed, but it ’s school … " Now the 13-year-old refugee has become one of the top students in his new school in Lebanon.

            The Central American children coming over the United States border are frequently fleeing violence, abuse, and crippling poverty. To learn more about this humanitarian crisis, visit our   unaccompanied children webpage. We work closely
            with
            the U.S. government agencies to ensure that the   the refugee children and families are treated humanely and fairly. The facilitates that hold unaccompanied children are generally not allowed to accept donated goods. Many of the children
            coming to the U.S. have family members domestically who can care for them. However, shelters and foster families are a critical need for other children and families. This would be run through your local child welfare organization, and
            would
            be required by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These children's rights should be protected.

            So it depends on what the children tell us. When we arrived, on Monday, there were approximately three hundred and fifty children there. There were over a hundred young children when we first arrived. Children described to us that they
            ’ve
            been there for three weeks or longer. And sometimes we hear about the littlest children being alone by themselves on the floor. Some of the children that we interviewed had been separated from their parents. There were children at this
            facility who came across with parents and were separated from parents. There were other children at the facility who came across with other adult family members. But they were not unaccompanied children. Things have always been horrendous
            in Border Patrol facilities, especially for children.

            Democratic institutions, rights, and values are clearly and explicitly under attack; not just at the federal level, but in state and local governments across the country. We now wake up wondering what new crisis our government will create
            for the American people each day. In the wake of the 2016 election, more than 125,000 lawyers and concerned citizens joined together to resist these threats through two new organizations:   Lawyers for Good Government ( L4GG ) and the
            Lawyers for Good Government Foundation ( L4GG Foundation ).

          <p>
            The Washington Post ’s Nick Miroff explains what ’s at stake. Law enforcement officials worry that by publicly discussing the plan, Trump has undermined the chances of capturing those on the target list, as it could have pushed migrants
            with deportation orders underground. ’ ”
            Morgan and others at ICE insist the operation is crucial to uphold the integrity of the U.S. immigration system. ”
            Families can not be exempted, he said: The law must be applied fairly and equally. [ Before Trump ’s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass family arrests ] ”
            Morgan this week urged families with deportation orders to turn themselves in to ICE, and he said that operations targeting those who defy court orders would reinforce the administration ’s broader deterrent efforts.

            Jun 12, 2019 Ten years ago, 15-year-old May was taken from her hometown in Fuzhou, China — against her will — and brought to the United States. During her 8-month journey to the U.S.-Mexico border, May endured thirst, hunger, robbery, and
            sexual assault as she was handed off from stranger to stranger. When she finally reached the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration authorities identified her as an unaccompanied child and sent her to a children ’s facility in Chicago.

            camps. As does Mike Godwin, the originator of “ Godwin ’s Law ” ( “ Yes, we should call border detention centers “ concentration camps. ” Here ’s what RAICES is reporting about the detention centers:
            Right now in McAllen, Texas hundreds of migrants are locked up in what are akin to disaster relief camps the day after an earthquake. This is the fourth child who ’s died in government custody in the last 6 months.

            ‘ There Is a Stench ’: Some of the children have been there for nearly a month. The overwhelming majority of children have not bathed since they crossed the border. The border station in Clint is only one of those with problems. So many
            children are sick, they have the flu, and they ’re not being properly treated, ” she said. It said there were dozens more children under the age of 12. The separated children were now alone, being cared for by other young detainees. When
            the lawyers arrived, federal officials said that more than 350 children were detained at the facility. Some sick children were being quarantined in the facility. Among the guidelines set under the legal settlement are that facilities for
            children must be “ safe and sanitary. ” “

            refugee ’ to these camps. They are not refugee camps. They are camps of concentration. Between 1914 and 1918, camps were constructed on an unprecedented scale across six continents. Some of these camps were clearly not safe for those
            interned. While some kinds of camps were understood to be harsher, after World War What kind of conditions can we expect to develop in these border camps? We have yet to discover what those will be for these American border camps. The
            death
            camps were still two years away. The United States now has a vast and growing camp system. Is it possible this growth in the camp system will be temporary and the improvised border camps will soon close? Once there are concentration
            camps,
            it is always probable   that things will get worse.

            camp — for it to be a concentration camp. Probably not. There have been some protests against the detention camps, but they have n’t been loud or sustained. ”

            About this Event
            Friends, we lamentably continue to witness the medical negligence that asylum-seeking families face while in ICE custody. As we receive hundreds of families every day, we see that they experience illnesses that could have been treated
            under ICE's care, but ICE did NOTHING. Join us on July 2nd at 9 AM in front of ICE's offices in downtown Phoenix in order to fight against the inhumane conditions that exacerbate the lives of people legally seeking asylum! Tags

            Inspired by the Tiffany Haddish interview with David Letterman on My Next Guest No Introduction, Immigrant Families Together has pledged to send 100 sets of duffel bag rolling suitcases and backpacks to our partners in El Paso. The reason
            we ’ve taken this commitment on is when all your worldly belongings are in a trash bag you ’re treated like trash and feel like trash. Our Director, Julie Schwietert Collazo witnessed this first hand last fall. Tiffany Haddish said, “ I
            remember when I got my first suitcase, I felt like I was a traveler, like I had a purpose, like I ’m a person, like I ’m not garbage, I got this I ’m not garbage.

            Welcome to La Posada Providencia! La Posada Providencia, is an emergency shelter for men, women and families who flee to the United States due to political oppression, natural disaster, and other life-threatening actions in their native
            countries. They seek legal asylum or other legal recourse to begin new lives in this country. Since 1989, La Posada has provided resettlement assistance to thousands of people from close to 100 different countries. Located in the lower

            Grande Valley of South Texas, La Posada provides a stabilizing support system for immigrants and asylum seekers as they wait for their cases to be adjudicated before the U.S. Immigration Court and for asylees as they take steps to toward
            achieving permanent resident status.

            Time: 10:00 a.m. The narrative that refugees and immigrants are criminals is not true. Annunciation House and our partner organizations and faith communities have been providing hospitality to thousands of these families every week. A
            refugee mother from Honduras forcibly separated for over 115 days from her three and four-year-old daughters by Border Patrol Agents on October 11, 2018. 2. A newly-arrived refugee parent who fled violence and persecution in Central
            America
            to lawfully seek asylum in the United States. 3. A former refugee who was granted asylum in the United States and who has since become a valued member of our vibrant border community. Following the press conference, the speakers — along
            with Annunciation House Executive Director Ruben Garcia and Legal Coordinator Taylor Levy — will have limited availability for individual interviews with members of the press.

            Not until 39 hours later — after two nights in a van — did the last child step out of a van to be reunited. In July, many migrant children awaiting reunification were forced to stay overnight in vans at the facility. Not until 39 hours
            later — after two nights in a van — did the last child step out of a van to be reunited. And those separated should be cared for as if they were our own children until they are reunified with their parents. The children began to sleep in
            the vans. At 1:30 a.m. Sunday, 11 hours after arrival, the first child was reunified. Not until 5:50 a.m. on Tuesday was the final child reunified. " "

          <p>
            I ’ve Been to Guantanamo. It ’s Over the last year, the country has been shocked by reports of the inhumane treatment of children and families in immigrant detention. Now, the Trump administration appears to be increasing the scope and
            severity of its immigrant detention scheme by potentially detaining immigrants at Guantanamo Bay. I ’ve been to Guantanamo. It is certainly no place for children. But sending kids to Guantanamo is uniquely dangerous. The Trump
            administration might argue they have no rights at Guantanamo at all. History tells us that politicians might excuse or willfully turn a blind eye to abuses that happen at Guantanamo. Guantanamo ’s longer history helps explain why. More
            than 45,000 people were taken to Guantanamo and held in tent cities. There ’s a horrific American tradition of holding people at Guantanamo unlawfully.

            I ’ve been to detention facilities where I ’ve walked up to these individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under, ” Morgan said on “ Tucker Carlson Tonight ” in January. I ’ve looked at them and I ’ve looked at their eyes, Tucker —
            and I ’ve said that is a soon-to-be MS-13 gang member. It ’s unequivocal. ” The outlet found Morgan notched nearly 100 television and radio appearances after a series of interviews with Tucker Carlson. Sanaa Abrar, advocacy director with
            the pro- migrant United We Dream, said Morgan's remark reflects the Trump administration ’s broader efforts to target immigrant youth. Morgan ’s comment echoed statements by President Donald Trump. — Morgan argued that unaccompanied
            minors could be recruited by violent gangs.

            the third migrant child to die in U.S. custody since December. Eight-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo   died on Dec. 24, 2018, in border patrol custody after developing the flu. All three children were from Guatemala, a Central American
            country where economic hardship, crime and corruption have sent increasing numbers northward seeking opportunity and safety. " First published on May 3, 2019 / 12:28 PM

            But the officer “ was n’t even allowed to make an argument ” that the asylum seeker should be allowed to stay in the US to pursue his case. The role that asylum officers play in the MPP process is very different from the one they
            typically play. Under MPP, though, migrants are automatically allowed to apply for asylum before a judge in the US — the asylum officer just determines whether they are sent back to Mexico in the meantime. As a result, both asylum
            officers and the migrants they interview are unprepared. The asylum seekers they were speaking to were even less ready: And it ’s not a standard that asylum officers are familiar with. Here ’s how it typically works: An asylum officer ’s
            write-up is reviewed by their supervisor.

            Sierra Club v. Trump — Challenge to Trump ’s National Emergency Declaration to Construct a Border Wall
            Updated :
            Add your name
            In February 2019, the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump ’s emergency powers declaration to secure funds to build a wall along the southern border. If border wall construction is carried out as directed under the president
            ’s emergency declaration, it would harm communities living along the border, endanger wildlife, and have devastating impacts on the environment. The hyper-militarization of the border wall, accelerated by the president ’s declaration,
            would increase anti- immigrant sentiment and marginalize communities of color even further. The 2019 Appropriations Act passed by Congress explicitly rejected President Trump ’s $ 5.7 billion demand for a border wall and forbade
            construction in certain areas, including carve-outs for wildlife areas.

            A Justice Department report, released by Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, said that there were 4,500 complaints in four years about the sexual harassment and abuse of immigrant children in United States custody.
            CreditCreditTom Brenner / They also included cases of suspected abuse of children by other minors. “ ” But the number of complaints rose after the Trump administration enacted its separation policy. Of those, 342 allegations were referred
            to the Justice Department, the report showed. Jonathan White of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, who last year repeatedly warned a top official in Health and Human Services that the family separation policy
            could permanently traumatize young children. That is false! ”

            most of the adults spent years as refugees during Guatemala ’s 1960- 1996 civil war, in which the US-backed military committed a genocide on the country ’s indigenous population. But the peace deal did nothing to end Guatemala ’s systemic
            racism and corruption, which has channelled the country ’s wealth to a small urban elite, and the people of the surrounding Nentón municipality were forced to rebuild their communities without any governmental support. Such grinding
            poverty makes emigration an attractive alternative, according to the town ’s mayor, Lucas Pérez.

            Update 6/24/19: President Trump has announced plans to unleash a wave of ICE raids across the country to conduct mass arrests and deportations. The Department of Homeland Security is the Trump administration's key tool for terrorizing
            immigrants. DHS is responsible for inflicting heinous abuses on children in its custody – long before they started tear gassing them and ripping them away from their families and detaining them as part of the vile family separation
            policy. The department has also unleashed ICE and CBP to lawlessly antagonize immigrant communities throughout this country in our homes, workplaces, and daily commutes. We call on Congress to refuse to bend to Trump ’s abusive
            immigration policies. We wo n't allow our taxpayer dollars to fund DHS's abuse of immigrants.

            This law makes crossing the border without legal authorization a federal misdemeanor. And they claimed that necessitated placing the parents in U.S. Marshals custody and sometimes in federal prison, while their children were transferred
            to the Department of Health and Human Services. Since 2005, though, criminal prosecutions for unauthorized border crossing have skyrocketed, and in 2017 and 2018,   they comprised 57 percent of all federal criminal case filings
            nationwide. That ’s more than white collar prosecutions, more than drug-related prosecutions, and more than weapons prosecutions. Like so much of the criminal system, the system under which migrants are prosecuted for crossing the border
            is replete with due process problems. These prosecutions have a profound human cost, and they also cost U.S. taxpayers.

          <p>
            We have since seen a number of proposals from both the Trump administration and Congress to pay for Trump ’s wall fetish. One was to provide $ 1.6 billion for his border wall along with a whopping $ 1 billion of “ reprogrammed funds ” for
            Trump to use on “ immigration-related issues. The 2018 spending bill for DHS, passed by Congress in March, included $ 1.375 billion in funding for border barriers Because the 2018 border funding prohibited the use of Trump ’s wall
            prototypes and specified projects for “ fencing, ” “ replacement walls ” or “ levee walls, ” some incorrectly assume that the bill did not include wall funding. ’s desire to divert $ 450 million in Department of Defense funding toward
            wall construction in Arizona.

          <p>
            One of the standouts is the Keep Washington Working Act, which will affect nearly one million Washingtonians — one in every seven people in the state — who are immigrants. And Connecticut ’s governor just signed into law a measure to
            strengthen the state ’s Trust Act, which is designed to protect due process rights of immigrants by requiring a judicial order to detain an individual for ICE. llinois ’ legislature also extended the state ’s effective ban on for-profit
            prisons to include ICE private prisons. Employers worry that ICE ’s indiscriminate targeting of immigrant communities will force immigrants into the shadows and out of the state. Expect other states to follow Washington ’s lead in passing
            pro- immigrant laws — through coalitions of local industries and community activists. ’s increasingly anti- immigrant rhetoric and policy.

          <p>
            The Immigration System Is Inhumane. Federal immigration agents are conducting workplace and community raids across the country, arresting immigrants at check-in appointments and green card interviews, and targeting courthouses and
            Greyhound bus stations. But the Trump administration is not alone in its responsibility for the past two years of brutal immigration enforcement. ’s mandate will be to overhaul our immigration system and build one that upholds our values.
            An ICE detainer is a request to a state or local law enforcement agency to jail someone until the person can be taken into federal immigration custody. Once arrested, immigrants are jailed in a detention system that has grown in size by
            60 % in just two years. The ACLU is asking for a commitment to decreasing immigration detention by at least 75 %.

            Immigrant Kids Keep Dying in CBP Detention Centers, and DHS Wo Their deaths reveal just how dire the conditions are under which U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) are holding hundreds of children. CBP has dealt with even higher
            levels of border crossers in the past and has 17 times   the budget it did in 1990. Appropriators are currently deciding the next budget for DHS, including ICE and CBP, and they should ensure the agencies are not granted any more funding
            while children and adults continue to be abused and die while in custody. Our lawsuit to reunite families — which includes some of the children enduring these horrific CBP conditions — is ongoing. At the Border Rights Center, we are
            monitoring CBP to ensure that their actions no longer go unnoticed.

          <p>
            For hundreds of these children, the nightmare is n’t over yet. How many children are still in ORR care? , there were 2,654 children initially determined to have been possibly separated from their parents. We believe that every separated
            child and parent who want to be reunified should be reunified. These 120 children fall into two groups: 50 with parents who were removed from the U.S. by the government and 70 whose parents are still in the U.S.
            Children with parents outside the U.S. Children with parents inside the U.S. ( all numbers as of 10/15 )
            About 70 children in ORR care have parents who are still in this country. Once this parent is transferred back to ICE custody, they may then be able to be reunited with their children. a danger to the child.

            We are currently handling an influx of cases related to the Trump administration “ zero tolerance ” policy that has created the family separation crisis. We are engaged in the release of refugee parents from detention, and reunion with
            their separated children. * * To support families in need please donate here. Funds received will help cover bail bonds for families who can not afford it, travel expenses for family members to visit detained children, travel expenses of
            released refugees to their final destination, purchase of mobile phones and emergency living expenses,   and other expenses that refugee families may incur in recovering from the nightmare of the Administration's zero tolerance policy.
            Donations are also used to pay for the travel of lawyers and paralegals to help defend refugees and their children in detention centers scattered across the country.

            Media fight access restrictions on child detention centers
            June 26, 2018
            Print The children at the center of the national debate over President Donald Trump ’s immigration policy have been heard about but rarely seen. News organizations say they are pushing back every day against Trump administration
            restrictions on access to facilities where children separated from their parents are being held. Audio obtained by ProPublica of crying children at a federal facility was influential before Trump changed his policy — even though there
            were no visuals. Children are seen in neat lines and in what looks like government-issued clothing, but no faces are seen. I wonder what else is there Ortiz said the handouts also raise questions, noting that the children seen are boys.
            There are no pictures of girls, ” he said. Where are they? ”

            President Trump has faced immense political pressure to end the separation of migrant families at the border. I did n’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated. ” ” Mr. Marriott said that “ reunification is always the
            goal ” and that the agency “ is working toward that ” for the children separated from their families because of Mr. Trump ’s policy. The order does not say where the families would be detained. Are we going to be able to detain alien
            families together or are we not? ” ’s separation of families. The border ’s just as tough, but we do want to keep families together. That ’s a tough dilemma.

            An unapologetic President Donald Trump defended his administration ’s border-protection policies Monday in the face of rising national outrage over the forced separation of migrant children from their parents. Calling for tough action
            against illegal immigration, Trump declared the U.S. “ will not be a migrant camp ” on his watch. The children are being held separately from parents who are being prosecuted under the administration ’s “ zero-tolerance ” policy for
            illegal border crossings. In fact, it was Trump ’s administration that broke with longstanding practice of processing migrant families in civil, rather than criminal, proceedings that allow families to be held together. One cage had 20
            children inside. We do not want to separate parents from their children, ” he said.

            Are Children Being Kept in' Cages' at the Border? But are those cages? One cage had 20 children inside. But this is abuse of the language, too. The point is that these children are incarcerated. The cages are n’t wholly new. What is
            different now is that the children being held are being forcibly separated from their parents at the border. the Washington Examiner reports that there could be 30,000 such children in custody by August. This is violence to the English
            language. The claim is that the policy is aimed at adults, not at children, but the effect is the same. The laws are the laws. It could be a tough deterrent — would be a tough deterrent.

            We also are spending so much tax payer money on Mexico and Cuba citizens flooding our boarders. Just think of the money Clinton has spent running for 2 years and maybe a 3rd. That ’s the money needed for a good cause. Not spending 500
            million at the chance to get a 4 year job that only pays 2 million a year. That ’s tax money and we have citizens who have been here dying we do n’t help. If not we take over Mexico and fix issue. Again they who complain should be taxed
            and if it means their entire pay check so be it. Pay the bill. Those who are n’t upset with this but who are upset with the rampant illegal issue. We do n’t want to spent our tax money on that.

            The Trump administration says it might hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement officers. A new app warns undocumented Americans ( or people who are rightfully worried they might be accused of being one ) about anti- immigrant raids so
            they
            can flee before the immigration forces come for them. Preferably, one of these should be a user who is also a lawyer. There are three kinds of raid reports – home raids, work raids, and traffic checkpoints. Only work raid and traffic
            checkpoint alerts will be sent out. February 12, 2017

            Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley is the charitable branch of the Diocese of Brownsville. The architecture of the humanitarian respite center should reflect the generosity and warmth of the Rio Grande Valley community. We should
            provide spaces of welcome and support to help the most vulnerable regain hope and dignity for their difficult journeys ahead. The center should provide support for refugees and volunteers alike, educating and raising awareness of the
            ongoing issues with the immigrant community. We believe in the generosity of the people of the Valley and beyond, Catholics and non- Catholics, as a continuing sign that affirms human dignity and compassion.

            On World Refugee Day, we ’re reminded that the refugee crisis has grown in recent years; there are over 70 million people displaced worldwide today Who exactly is a refugee? How do other countries treat refugees? The UNHCR has great
            resources that introduce who refugees are, and discusses the differences between refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers. If you do n’t have miles to donate, you can also donate cash to help refugees and asylum seekers reunite with family.
            Together, a few examples of nonprofits with strong service programs to help refugees and asylum seekers. Urge your country to stand with refugees by contacting your elected representatives. Donate items to a refugee donation center.
            Volunteer at a refugee non- profit or agency Fostering a refugee child through our partner LIRS is another way to help.

            the Children trustee Jennifer Garner visited children in a shelter in Deming, NM. Right now, one of the most heartbreaking topics in the news is the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. Recently, the Trump administration
            announced
            plans to cut funds to educational, legal and recreational programs for children detained at the border. Donate to Save the Children Save the Children staff are currently at the border providing lifesaving care to children who ’ve endured
            trauma, dangerous voyages and so much more. Save the Children is a leader in this space. They ’ve protected and advocated for vulnerable children for 100 years now. The center offers children a safe space to play, relax, read – Though it
            can sometimes feel like it, we ’re never voiceless when it comes to helping children.

            faceted needs of our immigrant community members, including through legal, social, educational, and medical services. The OTG Advocates work primarily with families detained at the Berks detention facility. Aldea ’s legal efforts are
            supported by volunteer attorneys and advocates who specialize in immigration law and who have years of expertise representing under-served immigrant communities. Although Aldea ’s legal services are open to all low income individuals,
            Aldea
            assists several specific categories of individuals:
            Unaccompanied minors and minor immigrant children.

            TCRP is fighting around the clock to reunite the 381 families we represent and to ensure that they get excellent legal representation on their underlying immigration claims. We ’ll continue to go to court every day in South Texas to
            monitor
            and protect against the ever-changing policies of the Trump Administration for as long as it is necessary. Our lawyers are working to stop family separation permanently in an action against the United States before an international human
            rights body called the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights.

            MASS CRIMINALIZATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES Everyday, people of color in the United States are being criminalized for their economic condition, their race, their migrant status, gender and so much more. There is a pandemic of mass
            criminalization that is ravaging our neighborhoods and our society. Structural racism and oppression would have us believe that we are inherently flawed, that we are criminals. However, the real crime is demonizing, criminalizing and
            imprisoning millions of young men and women, relegating them to the margins of society as disenfranchised, unemployable pariahs. African Americans and other communities of color, including immigrants are being profiled, surveilled, locked
            up and locked out of society.

            Educators for Migrant Justice is ESGTI ’s flagship grassroots advocacy campaign fighting to end pension fund complicity in the migrant abuse crisis. We achieved our first campaign win in November when we successfully pushed the country ’s
            second largest pension fund, the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System ( CalSTRS ) to divest from for-profit prison companies CoreCivic and GEO Group over their human rights abuses of migrants and other detainees. The campaign has
            since expanded to the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System ( CalPERS ) as well as the Oregon Public Employees ’ Retirement System. CalPERS Members: Take Action!

            I would never recommend people put that much trust in me. With open-source software, instead of having to trust a few unknown developers, you are trusting a community of developers that are monitoring, auditing, finding issues, and
            helping
            fix them. I'm a developer, how can I help? I'm not a coder, how can I help? There is no monetization strategy for this. How will the verified report reach the local communities impacted by the sweeps / raids? Will this be an automatic
            process or human-managed / vetted / supervised? We're currently working with advocacy groups and legal organizations to determine the processes for reporter verification and for verifying and sending out alerts. For people, by people |

            Families are arriving in our border region desperate for our help. They have traveled hundreds, if not thousands of miles to flee extreme conditions that imperil their survival. Immigration authorities are releasing these families and
            giving them the right to live in the U.S. while they await the outcome of their application for asylum. They urgently need money to be able to unite with family members elsewhere in the country. Our faith community is collecting funds to
            pay for these families ’ bus and airline tickets and other immediate transportation needs. As people of faith, we are compelled to welcome the stranger. In addition to keeping them in your prayers, your donation today can have a big
            impact
            in the lives of these vulnerable families. Your generosity and heart will help these families on their journey.

            Freedom University is a modern-day freedom school for undocumented students in Atlanta, Georgia. OUR HISTORY
            Freedom University opened its doors in 2011 following the passage of Georgia Board of Regents' Policy 4.1.6, which bans undocumented youth from attending Georgia's top public universities, and Policy 4.3.4, which bans undocumented
            students
            from in-state tuition. And while more than 20 states allow undocumented students to attend public universities or qualify for in-state tuition, Georgia is the only state to ban DACA students from admission to its top universities and from
            in-state tuition. WHAT WE DO
            To fulfill the human right to education of undocumented youth in Georgia, Freedom University welcomes undocumented students ages 17- 25 and provides them with free college preparation courses in a safe learning environment.

            Families who have been admitted into the United States as asylum-seekers need to travel from Phoenix to their families or sponsors across the country while they await immigration proceedings. Instead, ICE agents drive buses of families
            directly to local churches who indicate they have the temporary capacity to receive the families and assist with travel arrangements. These families need basic necessities, such as food, bathing, and medical attention. Furthermore, these
            families are required to report to immigration offices across the country to proceed with the asylum-seeking process, despite not being provided with organized travel arrangements. However, these organizations can no longer keep up with
            the
            demand, and ICE has started repeatedly and consistently dropping off busloads of asylum-seeking families at Phoenix bus stations.

            is
            a critical shortage of non- profit immigration legal services in greater Boston, most especially on the side of Boston Harbor where most of our Central American community resides. Some of the non- citizens who most need immigration law
            services are least able to pay for access to justice, and we are ready to meet their needs as soon as possible.

            After this meeting I feel that I will be able to sleep tonight. An attorney is really important in an immigration case, especially if you are in detention. In this facility everything is hard if you do n’t have a lawyer I want to
            appreciate your effort towards my asylum process. You have given me a good advice that I have to thank you for all that you have done for me. Madam I just want to inform you that I was granted a bond. And I will continue my court
            proceedings outside. – Asylum seeker from Guinea
            Migrant Center issues press release calling for the immediate halt of the Administration's Remain in Mexico program. Guatemalan man forcibly separated from his wife and young child is granted a parole bond and is now reunited with his
            family.

            Regardless of your immigration status, you have guaranteed rights under the Constitution. Remember your immigration number ( “ A ” number ) and give it to your family. Do n’t discuss your immigration status with anyone but your lawyer.
            While you are in jail, an immigration agent may visit you. Never flee from an immigration checkpoint. only answer questions in the presence of an attorney, no matter your citizenship or immigration status. You do not have to answer
            questions about your immigration status. An immigration officer can not arrest you without “ probable cause. If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. If you are over 18,
            carry your immigration documents with you at all times.

            Are immigration officials allowed to stop people in places wholly inside the U.S.? Furthermore, as a general matter, these agents ’ jurisdiction extends only to immigration violations and federal crimes. You do not have to answer
            questions about your immigration status. Generally, an immigration officer can not detain you without “ reasonable suspicion. An immigration officer also can not search you or your belongings without either “ probable cause ” or your
            consent. An immigration officer can not arrest you without “ probable cause. ” If you have valid immigration documents and are over the age of 18, the law does require you to carry those documents on you. No matter what category you fall
            into, never provide false documents to immigration officials.

            There is no deadline by when applications are due. However, the Trump administration has already appealed the court order requiring that it accept renewal applications. It is possible that the court order will be reversed by another court
            and that the administration will stop accepting renewal applications. Print:

            Let the U.N. Report on Six Dead Children in Trump ’s America
            After 10 years in which not one child died in U.S. custody, at least six children have died in the last eight months. And in the past eight months, six migrant children have died in custody of the Trump regime. ( Did the Trump
            administration intentionally conceal the death of this 10-year-old child that occurred just five weeks before the November 2018 elections? Let ’s be clear: Trump ’s rhetoric, and his policies, means he bears personal responsibility for
            these children ’s deaths. While congressional Democrats have been calling out Trump administration actions, more is needed before additional children die. The U.N. has already been following Trump ’s immigration policies. ” They were
            rebuffed by the Trump regime.

            March for Immigrant Justice
            From" zero tolerance" to the separation of families and detention of 15,000 + children, and the blocking of ports of entry to asylum-seekers-current immigration policies are inhumane, racist and unjustified, and must be loudly rejected.
            In
            June of 2018, we rallied and marched in 60 + cities nationwide and 20 + cities worldwide to protest family separation. Since then, separations are down, but THEY ARE STILL HAPPENING along with a steady stream of other horrors. Join

            day, community bond funds raise money to free our friends and neighbors from immigration detention and make sure they are able to work on their case from a place of freedom. To contribute to a local community bond fund that is paying for
            immigration bond, see the list below. To contribute to the centralized   2019 Freedom Spring Fund that will be distributed across all immigration bond funds on the below list, DONATE HERE. Note: To return to the full directory of the

            Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route: Natalia and Mario ’s story
            Imagine escaping horrific violence and arriving to a new country with merely the clothes on your back. This is the situation for thousands of people fleeing organized crime and gang violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America and
            seeking safety in neighboring countries. When they arrived, Natalia and Mario faced many challenges. Asylum Access established Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route to create more welcoming communities for refugees. The Hospitality Route
            creates movement among all sectors of society to share the message of “ welcome ” to refugees in Mexico. Natalia and Mario were some of the first beneficiaries of the Hospitality Route program.

            For 10 years, the New Sanctuary Coalition has been led by and for immigrants to stop the inhumane system of deportations and detentions in this country. New Sanctuary springs from New York ’s faith-based and social justice communities and
            forms a unique family of citizens and immigrants, bound by a love of humanity and mutual respect. Accompaniment   provides citizen-witnesses of ICE ’s behavior, emotional support for immigrants and also establishes that our friends have
            strong ties to the local community, a fact appreciated by immigration judges. Altogether, NSC has helped thousands of immigrant families.

            am I right? you know this is not going to end well. So, I get why you ’re stressed out. They weigh on many of you because not all policies currently being ordered are written, not all orders being given by management are legal. Just
            following orders ” wo n’t hack it when this is all over. Are cheating on their spouses? Are on their second or third divorce? Demand that all orders must be written and signed. That is what being a law enforcement officer is about. It is
            not enforcement at whatever cost. It is what Honor First actually means. Jenn Budd is a former Senior Patrol Agent and Intelligence Agent with the U.S. Border Patrol and an independent blogger.

            Our mission is to reunite and defend the rights of families separated by inhumane immigration policies. Project Corazon, run by the Lawyers for Good Government Foundation in partnership with nearly 40 top law firms, was created to help
            reunite families separated by the administration's inhumane" zero-tolerance" policy. Since the launch of Project Corazon, we have expanded our mission, mobilizing thousands of lawyers to defend the rights of immigrants and their families.
            We're fighting to reunite and defend the rights of immigrant families. Working with a network of immigration legal services providers, volunteer lawyers, bilingual interpreters, and law firms across the country, Project Corazon is
            fighting to reunite separated families, defend the rights of detained immigrants, and provide assistance to immigrants recently released from detention.

            ProPublica uncovered a secret group for Customs and Border Patrol officers on Facebook, with 9,500 members * FYI there are a total of 20,000 CBP agents in the US. That means that almost HALF of the agency is in a racist &amp; sexually
            violent secret CBP Facebook group. This is ABHORRENT. CBP is responsible of caring for migrant children and refugees while detained. How can we expect a government agency like this one to care for them humanely, much less compassionately?

            WASHINGTON, June 25, 2019 – The American Bar Association is appalled by credible reports of hundreds of children being held in unsafe and unhealthy conditions in violation of federal and state law, court settlements and common decency.
            This week, the American public learned that children, including infants, were being held for up to weeks at a time in overcrowded federal facilities that lack the most basic of human necessities. The law requires that children who are
            held must be transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. We urge Congress to pass supplemental appropriations to ensure the appropriate treatment and care of unaccompanied immigrant children in government
            custody.

            Advocate? Volunteering as a Young Center Child Advocate means being a reliable, trustworthy, and professional presence for children who are in federal custody, and accordingly, we have a thorough clearance and training process. Once
            assigned to an individual child, each Child Advocate receives continuing training, support, and supervision from the Young Center for Immigrant Children ’s Rights. Visit with the child each week. Advocate for the best interest of the

            This is called a “ supplemental appropriations bill. Both the Senate and House include nearly the full amount of money but the Senate does n’t include replenishment of the essential refugee support services funding. Funding must support
            critical family reunification services. This has been included in both bills. This is included in the House bill but not sufficiently addressed in the Senate bill. So far this is not included in either bill. Right now, there ’s only
            enough money to support this program at a quarter of immigration detention facilities and five immigration courts. There is funding included in both bills but they do not include starting the non- detained pilot ). Unfortunately, both
            bills include some form of funding. The Senate bill includes DOD immigration funding.

            We resist policies and policy proposals that target and aim to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and discriminate against Black, Indigenous, Muslim, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ people. What is a sanctuary city? A “ sanctuary city ” means
            that there are policies in place to limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration officials ( ICE ), to protect basic human and civil rights of the city ’s residents. However, because there are some loopholes in our
            sanctuary policy and because there are so many federal agencies in DC that are not obligated to follow it, many immigrant DC residents – documented and undocumented – are being unlawfully deported. A sanctuary city should not comply with
            destructive immigration and registration policies.

            THE ATROCITIES BEING COMMITTED AGAINST IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES!!! There are good people in this world yes, some people DO care. History will point to this army of fierce hearted strangers who linked arms and marched toward the
            world ’s pain – who sacrificed for forgotten little ones they will never meet because there is no such thing as other people ’s children. Our goal yesterday was to raise $ 240,000 for emergency response and long-term legal accountability
            for the child detention crisis. You stopped your day and the world for these children.
