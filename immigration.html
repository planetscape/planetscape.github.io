          The Central American children coming over the United States border are frequently fleeing violence, abuse, and crippling poverty. To learn more about this humanitarian crisis, visit our   unaccompanied children webpage. We work closely with
          the U.S. government agencies to ensure that the   the refugee children and families are treated humanely and fairly. The facilitates that hold unaccompanied children are generally not allowed to accept donated goods. Many of the children
          coming to the U.S. have family members domestically who can care for them. However, shelters and foster families are a critical need for other children and families. This would be run through your local child welfare organization, and would
          be required by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. These children's rights should be protected.

          So it depends on what the children tell us. When we arrived, on Monday, there were approximately three hundred and fifty children there. There were over a hundred young children when we first arrived. Children described to us that they ’ve
          been there for three weeks or longer. And sometimes we hear about the littlest children being alone by themselves on the floor. Some of the children that we interviewed had been separated from their parents. There were children at this
          facility who came across with parents and were separated from parents. There were other children at the facility who came across with other adult family members. But they were not unaccompanied children. Things have always been horrendous
          in Border Patrol facilities, especially for children.

          Jun 12, 2019 Ten years ago, 15-year-old May was taken from her hometown in Fuzhou, China — against her will — and brought to the United States. During her 8-month journey to the U.S.-Mexico border, May endured thirst, hunger, robbery, and
          sexual assault as she was handed off from stranger to stranger. When she finally reached the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration authorities identified her as an unaccompanied child and sent her to a children ’s facility in Chicago.

          refugee ’ to these camps. They are not refugee camps. They are camps of concentration. Between 1914 and 1918, camps were constructed on an unprecedented scale across six continents. Some of these camps were clearly not safe for those
          interned. While some kinds of camps were understood to be harsher, after World War What kind of conditions can we expect to develop in these border camps? We have yet to discover what those will be for these American border camps. The death
          camps were still two years away. The United States now has a vast and growing camp system. Is it possible this growth in the camp system will be temporary and the improvised border camps will soon close? Once there are concentration camps,
          it is always probable   that things will get worse.

          - Petrit, former refugee
          For more than thirty years, LSS-SW has served some of the world ’s most persecuted people living right here in Tucson and Phoenix. Violence and armed conflict chase millions of people from their homes, their families, and their countries,
          forcing them to seek safety in other countries around the world. Every year, the President and the State Department identify global regions in which people have an exceptional need for protection outside of their home countries. With
          volunteers and community Welcome Teams, LSS-SW builds self-reliant foundations for approximately 1,000 refugees each year.

          Time: 10:00 a.m. The narrative that refugees and immigrants are criminals is not true. Annunciation House and our partner organizations and faith communities have been providing hospitality to thousands of these families every week. A
          refugee mother from Honduras forcibly separated for over 115 days from her three and four-year-old daughters by Border Patrol Agents on October 11, 2018. 2. A newly-arrived refugee parent who fled violence and persecution in Central America
          to lawfully seek asylum in the United States. 3. A former refugee who was granted asylum in the United States and who has since become a valued member of our vibrant border community. Following the press conference, the speakers — along
          with Annunciation House Executive Director Ruben Garcia and Legal Coordinator Taylor Levy — will have limited availability for individual interviews with members of the press.

          We are currently handling an influx of cases related to the Trump administration “ zero tolerance ” policy that has created the family separation crisis. We are engaged in the release of refugee parents from detention, and reunion with
          their separated children. * * To support families in need please donate here. Funds received will help cover bail bonds for families who can not afford it, travel expenses for family members to visit detained children, travel expenses of
          released refugees to their final destination, purchase of mobile phones and emergency living expenses,   and other expenses that refugee families may incur in recovering from the nightmare of the Administration's zero tolerance policy.
          Donations are also used to pay for the travel of lawyers and paralegals to help defend refugees and their children in detention centers scattered across the country.

          The Trump administration says it might hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement officers. A new app warns undocumented Americans ( or people who are rightfully worried they might be accused of being one ) about anti- immigrant raids so they
          can flee before the immigration forces come for them. Preferably, one of these should be a user who is also a lawyer. There are three kinds of raid reports – home raids, work raids, and traffic checkpoints. Only work raid and traffic
          checkpoint alerts will be sent out. February 12, 2017

          Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley is the charitable branch of the Diocese of Brownsville. The architecture of the humanitarian respite center should reflect the generosity and warmth of the Rio Grande Valley community. We should
          provide spaces of welcome and support to help the most vulnerable regain hope and dignity for their difficult journeys ahead. The center should provide support for refugees and volunteers alike, educating and raising awareness of the
          ongoing issues with the immigrant community. We believe in the generosity of the people of the Valley and beyond, Catholics and non- Catholics, as a continuing sign that affirms human dignity and compassion.

          On World Refugee Day, we ’re reminded that the refugee crisis has grown in recent years; there are over 70 million people displaced worldwide today Who exactly is a refugee? How do other countries treat refugees? The UNHCR has great
          resources that introduce who refugees are, and discusses the differences between refugees, asylees, and asylum seekers. If you do n’t have miles to donate, you can also donate cash to help refugees and asylum seekers reunite with family.
          Together, a few examples of nonprofits with strong service programs to help refugees and asylum seekers. Urge your country to stand with refugees by contacting your elected representatives. Donate items to a refugee donation center.
          Volunteer at a refugee non- profit or agency Fostering a refugee child through our partner LIRS is another way to help.

          the Children trustee Jennifer Garner visited children in a shelter in Deming, NM. Right now, one of the most heartbreaking topics in the news is the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. Recently, the Trump administration announced
          plans to cut funds to educational, legal and recreational programs for children detained at the border. Donate to Save the Children Save the Children staff are currently at the border providing lifesaving care to children who ’ve endured
          trauma, dangerous voyages and so much more. Save the Children is a leader in this space. They ’ve protected and advocated for vulnerable children for 100 years now. The center offers children a safe space to play, relax, read – Though it
          can sometimes feel like it, we ’re never voiceless when it comes to helping children.

          MASS CRIMINALIZATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES Everyday, people of color in the United States are being criminalized for their economic condition, their race, their migrant status, gender and so much more. There is a pandemic of mass
          criminalization that is ravaging our neighborhoods and our society. Structural racism and oppression would have us believe that we are inherently flawed, that we are criminals. However, the real crime is demonizing, criminalizing and
          imprisoning millions of young men and women, relegating them to the margins of society as disenfranchised, unemployable pariahs. African Americans and other communities of color, including immigrants are being profiled, surveilled, locked
          up and locked out of society.

          Educators for Migrant Justice is ESGTI ’s flagship grassroots advocacy campaign fighting to end pension fund complicity in the migrant abuse crisis. We achieved our first campaign win in November when we successfully pushed the country ’s
          second largest pension fund, the California State Teachers ’ Retirement System ( CalSTRS ) to divest from for-profit prison companies CoreCivic and GEO Group over their human rights abuses of migrants and other detainees. The campaign has
          since expanded to the California Public Employees ’ Retirement System ( CalPERS ) as well as the Oregon Public Employees ’ Retirement System. CalPERS Members: Take Action!

          I would never recommend people put that much trust in me. With open-source software, instead of having to trust a few unknown developers, you are trusting a community of developers that are monitoring, auditing, finding issues, and helping
          fix them. I'm a developer, how can I help? I'm not a coder, how can I help? There is no monetization strategy for this. How will the verified report reach the local communities impacted by the sweeps / raids? Will this be an automatic
          process or human-managed / vetted / supervised? We're currently working with advocacy groups and legal organizations to determine the processes for reporter verification and for verifying and sending out alerts. For people, by people | Join

          Families are arriving in our border region desperate for our help. They have traveled hundreds, if not thousands of miles to flee extreme conditions that imperil their survival. Immigration authorities are releasing these families and
          giving them the right to live in the U.S. while they await the outcome of their application for asylum. They urgently need money to be able to unite with family members elsewhere in the country. Our faith community is collecting funds to
          pay for these families ’ bus and airline tickets and other immediate transportation needs. As people of faith, we are compelled to welcome the stranger. In addition to keeping them in your prayers, your donation today can have a big impact
          in the lives of these vulnerable families. Your generosity and heart will help these families on their journey.

          Freedom University is a modern-day freedom school for undocumented students in Atlanta, Georgia. OUR HISTORY
          Freedom University opened its doors in 2011 following the passage of Georgia Board of Regents' Policy 4.1.6, which bans undocumented youth from attending Georgia's top public universities, and Policy 4.3.4, which bans undocumented students
          from in-state tuition. And while more than 20 states allow undocumented students to attend public universities or qualify for in-state tuition, Georgia is the only state to ban DACA students from admission to its top universities and from
          in-state tuition. WHAT WE DO
          To fulfill the human right to education of undocumented youth in Georgia, Freedom University welcomes undocumented students ages 17- 25 and provides them with free college preparation courses in a safe learning environment.

          Families who have been admitted into the United States as asylum-seekers need to travel from Phoenix to their families or sponsors across the country while they await immigration proceedings. Instead, ICE agents drive buses of families
          directly to local churches who indicate they have the temporary capacity to receive the families and assist with travel arrangements. These families need basic necessities, such as food, bathing, and medical attention. Furthermore, these
          families are required to report to immigration offices across the country to proceed with the asylum-seeking process, despite not being provided with organized travel arrangements. However, these organizations can no longer keep up with the
          demand, and ICE has started repeatedly and consistently dropping off busloads of asylum-seeking families at Phoenix bus stations.

          Other   BOSTON, MA
          Thank you for your interest in supporting pro bono life-changing legal services for vulnerable non- citizens throughout New England and beyond. OUR MISSION
          Golden Stairs Immigration Center provides life-changing legal services to vulnerable non- citizens. --Non-citizens facing unusually complicated legal situations which might otherwise cost tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees There is
          a critical shortage of non- profit immigration legal services in greater Boston, most especially on the side of Boston Harbor where most of our Central American community resides. Some of the non- citizens who most need immigration law
          services are least able to pay for access to justice, and we are ready to meet their needs as soon as possible.

          We identify, contact, defend and uplift the voice of refugee women jailed in the 8 detention facilities along the lower Texas border that we service. We support family members in traveling the country to make contact with their children in
          government hans,   and provide travel and emergency living expenses for family members released from detention. We fund the traveling expenses of US-based family members visiting detained children, and provide travel expenses for detained
          mothers and children upon release. We fund emergency food, clothing and other living expenses for refugee women, their children,   and other asylum seekers. We work pro- bono representing Central American refugee families fleeing violence
          and other threats in their home countries who are seeking asylum. Our clients are refugee women arrested by ICE along the lower Texas border.

          mostly immigrant farm workers. Today, courageous members of the Border Angels are honoring the legacy of my father by making a powerful statement against inhumanity and oppression endured on our border by innocent immigrants. Paul F.

          questions about your immigration status. An immigration officer can not arrest you without “ probable cause. If an agent asks you for documents, what you need to provide differs depending on your immigration status. If you are over 18,

          March for Immigrant Justice
          From" zero tolerance" to the separation of families and detention of 15,000 + children, and the blocking of ports of entry to asylum-seekers-current immigration policies are inhumane, racist and unjustified, and must be loudly rejected. In
          June of 2018, we rallied and marched in 60 + cities nationwide and 20 + cities worldwide to protest family separation. Since then, separations are down, but THEY ARE STILL HAPPENING along with a steady stream of other horrors. Join

          # MeltICE 2019-Support Freedom This Spring, we're raising money to free as many people as possible from immigration detention. On any given day in the U.S., there are over 55,000 people in immigration detention including children. Every
          day, community bond funds raise money to free our friends and neighbors from immigration detention and make sure they are able to work on their case from a place of freedom. To contribute to a local community bond fund that is paying for
          immigration bond, see the list below. To contribute to the centralized   2019 Freedom Spring Fund that will be distributed across all immigration bond funds on the below list, DONATE HERE. Note: To return to the full directory of the

          Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route: Natalia and Mario ’s story
          Imagine escaping horrific violence and arriving to a new country with merely the clothes on your back. This is the situation for thousands of people fleeing organized crime and gang violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America and
          seeking safety in neighboring countries. When they arrived, Natalia and Mario faced many challenges. Asylum Access established Mexico ’s first Hospitality Route to create more welcoming communities for refugees. The Hospitality Route
          creates movement among all sectors of society to share the message of “ welcome ” to refugees in Mexico. Natalia and Mario were some of the first beneficiaries of the Hospitality Route program.

          Welcome to New Sanctuary Coalition
          For 10 years, the New Sanctuary Coalition has been led by and for immigrants to stop the inhumane system of deportations and detentions in this country. New Sanctuary springs from New York ’s faith-based and social justice communities and
          forms a unique family of citizens and immigrants, bound by a love of humanity and mutual respect. Accompaniment   provides citizen-witnesses of ICE ’s behavior, emotional support for immigrants and also establishes that our friends have
          strong ties to the local community, a fact appreciated by immigration judges. Altogether, NSC has helped thousands of immigrant families.

          We resist policies and policy proposals that target and aim to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and discriminate against Black, Indigenous, Muslim, Latinx, and LGBTQ+ people. What is a sanctuary city? A “ sanctuary city ” means
          that there are policies in place to limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration officials ( ICE ), to protect basic human and civil rights of the city ’s residents. However, because there are some loopholes in our
          sanctuary policy and because there are so many federal agencies in DC that are not obligated to follow it, many immigrant DC residents – documented and undocumented – are being unlawfully deported. A sanctuary city should not comply with
          destructive immigration and registration policies.
